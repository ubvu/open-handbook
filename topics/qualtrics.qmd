## What is it?

Qualtrics is a cloud-based subscription and software platform (SaaS) that enables users to create and manage online surveys. The Qualtrics survey tool can support a variety of (complex) survey design requirements by providing such functionalities as different question types, display and branching logic configuration and the use of embedded data and APIs.

## What can it be used for?

All VU students, employees and researchers are eligible to make use of a Qualtrics licence. VU's Qualtrics licence usage is limited for creating, managing and collecting data for scientific research purposes only.

Qualtrics should not be used for non-scientific purposes such as the creation of registration or attendance lists and course evaluation surveys for example; instead users should go to other available tools such as [MS Forms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/online-surveys-polls-quizzes).

VU Amsterdam holds an academic licence which includes non-standard, advanced features and functions, including but not limited to:

* **FILE UPLOAD** – a non-standard question type that allows respondents to upload a file along with their survey response
* **SIGNATURE QUESTION** – a non-standard question type that presents survey participants with an entry box where they can draw their signature.
* **API INTEGRATION** – an advanced licence feature that can be used to automate repetitive processes inside of Qualtrics or to pass information in and out of Qualtrics.
* **OFFLINE SURVEY APP** – an advanced licence feature that comprises a downloadable application available for iOS and Android that allows you to administer surveys on your mobile device or tablet without an internet connection.

## How to request access

### Creating and Accessing User Accounts

VU Amsterdam Qualtrics Central Brand (hereafter VU's Central Brand) at [vuamsterdam.eu.qualtrics.com](https://vuamsterdam.eu.qualtrics.com) allows for user's auto-enrolment, an automated account creation and registration process. Any user with an enabled VU email address may auto-enroll on VU's Central Brand. The email address will function as the account's username.

VU's Central Brand makes use of Single-Sign On (SSO). This means that users can log in to Qualtrics using VU's internal login system. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory to all Qualtrics users utilising the vuamsterdam brand (i.e. employees and researchers – students will be informed of upcoming project for MFA implementation). MFA acts as an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorised users from accessing accounts and resources, even when the password has been stolen. Qualtrics will use multi-factor authentication to validate user identity and provide quick and convenient access to authorised users.

**To create a user account and access the Qualtrics environment** at the Central Brand, please proceed as follows:

1. Go to: [https://vuamsterdam.eu.qualtrics.com](https://vuamsterdam.eu.qualtrics.com)
2. On the login page, choose: Vrije Universiteit SSO
3. Log in with your VU account credentials (email address and password)
