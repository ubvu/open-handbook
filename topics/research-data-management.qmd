# Research Data Management

Research data management (RDM) concerns the organisation, documentation, storage, archiving and sharing of digital and analogue data. Data management applies throughout the entire research data life cycle, which is visualised in the circle above. RDM aims to ensure reliable verification of results, and permits new and innovative research built on existing information. RDM is also part of the research process and is intended to make the research process as efficient as possible. This LibGuide provides guidance on research data management planning, data storage and protection, data archiving, and other resources. The Data Management Plan provides information on how these activities will be carried out during the research project.

Good data management will heighten the quality of your own research (data) as well as your institutionâ€™s scientific output, and it contributes significantly to your field as a whole.

Good data management:

* Promotes the integrity of your research,
* Increases the impact of your research,
* Improves the quality of your data,
* Supports future use of your research data, and
* Complies with internal and external regulations.
