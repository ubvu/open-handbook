### What is it?
SciSure, previously known as eLabNext, is an application that supports researchers with documenting experiments and results in a digital lab journal. 
The SciSure platform is hosted by the company SciSure. SciSure is used by three faculties at VU Amsterdam: BETA, FGB and ACTA.

### What can it be used for?
SciSure is used as a digital labjournal where you can track your results and share data recorded in experiments in the electronic lab notebook. 
Experiments are organised by projects; each project can contain multiple studies. SciSure can also be used to document your inventory, e.g. samples. 
Next to this, SciSure can be used to create and share protocols and to register and book equipment.

### How to request access?
The VU SciSure key users can invite new users to the project group. Users can login through SSO using their VU credentials: [eLabNext](https://vu.elabnext.com).

### Are there costs involved? 
Costs are based on active licence seats and are on a yearly basis for the faculties ACTA, FGB and BETA. 
How expenses are charged is organised at faculty level. For more information about costs please contact your VU SciSure organisational admin.
