## Citation Elements

Citing data is not different from citing a publication. Make sure to check the rules of the journal to know how you should cite when writing an article for a specific academic journal. For all of the journals, however, the minimum compulsory elements in a data citation include:

* Author(s): Name of the author (creator) of the dataset
* Title: Name of the dataset
* Date of publication
* Publisher: Archive where dataset is stored
* Persistent Identifier: Unique identifier, most common is the DOI (see section [Data Publication](http://libguides.vu.nl/researchdata/data-publication)).

Optional elements that may be included in the reference are:

* File Type: Codebook, movie, software
* Version: Version number of the edition
* Creation Date
* Date of Consultation (last)

### Citation file

A citation file is a computer file that contains all information needed to cite a dataset. Several data and software repositories, such as Zenodo and GitHub, support this format and enables enables others to easily select the citation information in their preferred format. Most reference managers (e.g., Zenodo) can work with these standardized citation files, and automatically format the references in a document.

An example, CFF-file is given below, but to enable you to easily create a CFF-file you can use this [website](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/).
