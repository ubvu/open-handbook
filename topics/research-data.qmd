## What is Research Data?

When we talk about Research Data at VU Amsterdam, it is defined as the following:

> "Information that is collected, observed, generated, or reused for the purpose of underpinning academic research. Depending on the discipline, research data may consist of, for example, text, images, audio recordings, video, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographic data, or sensor measurements."

When we refer to research data in the [Research Data and Software Management Policy](https://rdm.vu.nl/public/policies-regulations/RDSM-policy-VU-EN-v3.0.pdf), we mean the entirety of the data itself, including any associated metadata, documentation, and contextual information necessary to understand, interpret, and reuse the data.

A widely used definition of research data is provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/frascati-manual-2015_9789264239012-en.html):

> “Research data are factual records (numerical scores, textual records, images, and sounds) used as primary sources for scientific research, and that are commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.”

This definition originates from the OECD *Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding* and is widely referenced in research data management guidance, for example by the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/researchdata/generate-collect/identifier-donnees-de-recherche/).

## What is *not* Research Data?

It is important to note that not all data used in research qualifies as research data.

For example, administrative data such as HR records, email correspondence, or generic software logs are typically **not** considered research data unless they are explicitly collected or repurposed to answer a research question.

Similarly, publicly available datasets that are reused without modification are not newly created research data. However, their use may still require appropriate documentation, citation, and ethical or legal consideration.

## Research Data Across the Research Lifecycle

Research data can be produced at different stages of the research lifecycle, including data collection, processing and analysis, and validation of results. Multiple versions of data may exist at each stage, such as raw data, processed data, and derived or aggregated datasets. Managing these different forms of research data appropriately is essential for transparency, reproducibility, and long-term reuse, in line with the FAIR data principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016).
