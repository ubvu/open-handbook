## What is Research Data?

Research Data can be defined as information that is collected, observed, generated, or reused for the purpose of underpinning academic research. Depending on the discipline, research data may consist of, for example, text, images, audio recordings, video, spreadsheets, databases, statistical data, geographic data, or sensor measurements.

When we refer to research data in this policy, we refer to the entirety of the data itself, including any associated metadata, documentation, and contextual information necessary to understand and reuse the data.

There is a widely used definition of research data from the [OECD]():

> “Research data are factual records (numerical scores, textual records, images, and sounds) used as primary sources for scientific research, and that are commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings.”

It is important to note that not all data used in research qualifies as research data.

For example, administrative data such as HR records, email correspondence, or generic software logs are typically not considered research data unless they are explicitly collected or repurposed to answer a research question.

Similarly, publicly available datasets that are used without modification are not newly created research data, although they may still require proper documentation, citation, and ethical consideration.

Research data can be produced at different stages of the research lifecycle, including during data collection, processing and analysis, and validation of results. Different types of data may exist at each stage, such as raw data, processed data, and derived or aggregated datasets.
