## What Is Preregistration?

Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan **before** you begin data collection and storing that plan in a time-stamped, read-only public repository. By registering your hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses in advance, you make your research decisions transparent and distinguish **confirmatory** analyses from **exploratory** ones.

According to the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/prereg), preregistration is a core open science practice that supports reproducibility and accountability. A practical guide to preregistering studies and registering data is available through the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://help.osf.io/article/330-welcome-to-registrations).

## Why Preregister?

Preregistering your research plan allows others to evaluate your study based on its **design, quality, and rigor**, rather than solely on its results. This is especially important for addressing **publication bias**, where studies reporting positive findings are more likely to be published than those with null or inconclusive results.

By specifying your hypotheses and analysis plan in advance, preregistration makes it clear which analyses were planned ahead of time and which were conducted post hoc. This transparency strengthens the credibility of your findings and helps readers, reviewers, and meta-analysts better interpret your work.

Importantly, preregistration does **not** prevent you from adapting your research as it develops. If deviations from the original plan become necessary, these changes can be clearly documented and justified in the final paper, for example:

- “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”  
- “In addition to the analyses we pre-registered, we also explored…”

## Types of Preregistration

There are two main forms of preregistration:

1. **Unreviewed preregistration**  
   Researchers publicly register their research plan in a registry before data collection. When the study is later submitted for publication, reviewers and readers can consult the preregistration to assess the alignment between the original plan and the reported analyses.

2. **Reviewed preregistration (Registered Reports)**  
   Researchers submit a detailed research proposal to a journal **prior to data collection**. The proposal is peer reviewed, and the journal makes an in-principle acceptance decision based on the **theoretical motivation and methodological rigor**, rather than the study’s results.
