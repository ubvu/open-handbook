## What is Preregistration?

Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan at the beginning of your study and storing that plan in a read-only public repository. By submitting your research plan into a registry, you make your hypotheses and methods transparent, which helps improve the rigor and quality of your research. According to the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/prereg), preregistration is a key practice in open science that supports reproducibility and accountability. Practical guidance on how to preregister a study is also available via [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/preregister-your-research-plan).

## Why Preregister?

Preregistration is particularly useful for addressing **publication bias**, which occurs when studies with positive results are more likely to be published than those with negative or inconclusive results. By registering your study design and analysis plan beforehand, reviewers and readers can evaluate your study based on its **quality and rigor** rather than just the outcomes.  

It’s important to note that preregistration does **not lock you into your original plan**. If your research evolves, you can clearly document deviations in your paper, for example:  

- “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”  
- “In addition to the analyses we pre-registered, we also explored…”

## Types of Preregistration

There are two main types of preregistration:

1. **Unreviewed preregistration**  
   Researchers publicly register their research plan in a registry. Reviewers of the resulting publication can check the original hypotheses, study design, and analysis plan.  

2. **Reviewed preregistration (Registered Reports)**  
   Researchers submit a detailed research proposal to a journal **before data collection**. The journal provides feedback and a decision on acceptance based on the quality of the proposed research design and methods, rather than the study results.
