## What Is Preregistration?

Preregistration is the practice of documenting your research plan **before** you begin data collection and storing that plan in a time-stamped, read-only public repository. By registering your hypotheses, methods, and planned analyses in advance, you make your research decisions transparent and distinguish **confirmatory** analyses from **exploratory** ones.

According to the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/prereg), preregistration is a core open science practice that supports reproducibility and accountability. A practical guide to preregistering studies and registering data is available through the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://help.osf.io/article/330-welcome-to-registrations).

### Types of Preregistration

There are two main forms of preregistration:

1. **Unreviewed preregistration**  
   Researchers publicly register their research plan in a registry before data collection. When the study is later submitted for publication, reviewers and readers can consult the preregistration to assess the alignment between the original plan and the reported analyses.

2. **Reviewed preregistration (Registered Reports)**  
   Researchers submit a detailed research proposal to a journal **prior to data collection**. The proposal is peer reviewed, and the journal makes an in-principle acceptance decision based on the **theoretical motivation and methodological rigor**, rather than the study’s results.

## Why Preregister?

Preregistering your research plan allows others to evaluate your study based on its **design, quality, and rigor**, rather than solely on its results. This is especially important for addressing **publication bias**, where studies reporting positive findings are more likely to be published than those with null or inconclusive results.

By stating your hypotheses and analysis plan in advance, preregistration clearly shows which analyses were planned beforehand and which were added later into the study. This openness improves the creditability of your findins and helps readers, reviewers, and meta-analysts better understand your work. 

Importantly, preregistration does **not** prevent you from adapting your research as it develops. If deviations from the original plan become necessary, these changes can be clearly documented and justified in the final paper, for example:

- “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”  
- “In addition to the analyses we pre-registered, we also explored…”

## What to Include in a Study’s Preregistration

A preregistration should clearly document key decisions made before data collection or analysis to promote transparency and reduce questionable research practices (Krypotos et al., 2022).

### Research hypotheses
For confirmatory research, hypotheses should be stated clearly and specifically in advance to prevent flexible interpretation of results. Exploratory research does not require predefined hypotheses.

### Methodology
The preregistration should describe how the study will be conducted, including materials, procedures, data sources, and data collection methods. For studies using existing data, researchers should explain how the data were obtained and disclose any prior knowledge that could influence analyses. Whenever possible, study materials should be shared in a repository to support transparency and replication.

### Sample
Researchers should specify the intended sample characteristics and justify the planned sample size (e.g. through power analysis or other decision rules). Any stopping rules, adaptive sampling procedures, or use of pre-existing datasets should be clearly documented in advance, including how training and validation datasets will be defined where applicable.

### Data preprocessing
All planned data transformations, exclusions, and aggregation procedures should be specified in advance. If exact procedures cannot be fully predefined, researchers should describe planned sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of results.

### Statistical analysis
The preregistration should outline the planned statistical models, variables, and inferential framework (e.g. NHST or Bayesian analysis). Clear documentation of analytic decisions helps prevent bias and increases the credibility of findings. Preregistrations may be updated when necessary, but changes should be made transparently and documented.

### Templates and study-specific elements
Different study types require different preregistration elements. Researchers are encouraged to consult existing preregistration templates and select one appropriate to their field and research design (Krypotos et al., 2022).
