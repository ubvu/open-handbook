## Data archiving and publishing

### Research Data Repositories
- **[Yoda](/topics/yoda.qmd)**: Long-term archiving via Yoda Vault with permanent DOIs and multiple access levels
- **[DataverseNL](/topics/dataversenl.qmd)**: Open and restricted dataset publishing with rich metadata support. Suitable only for non-personal data.
- **[Open Science Framework (OSF)](/topics/osf.qmd)**: Platform for project management, collaboration, file storage, and pre-registration. Not strictly speaking a data repository, but data can be shared on OSF.

### Research Output Registration
- **[Pure](/topics/pure.qmd)**: Registration of all research output, including datasets and software per VU policy. Public visibility.

## Choosing a tool
Which tool is most suitable for your research can vary, depending on what sort of data you're dealing with, or whether you need to share data with external partners. Use the [data storage finder](https://vu.nl/en/research/storagefinder) to find some guidance on choosing a storage tool. When you have questions, about data storage or any other topic, do not hesitate to [contact the RDM Support Desk](mailto:rdm@vu.nl).

## Tool Not Listed?

If you need research tools that aren't provided by VU Amsterdam, you can contact the RDM Support Desk** at [rdm@vu.nl](mailto:rdm@vu.nl) to discuss your requirements. We can suggest an alternative or forward your question to the IT or procurement.
