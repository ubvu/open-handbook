## What is Amberscript?

[Amberscript](https://www.amberscript.com/en/) is an online transcription service that converts audio and video recordings into text. It offers both automated speech-to-text transcription and human-edited transcription, allowing researchers to choose the level of accuracy and detail appropriate for their needs. The service is commonly used in research workflows to support the analysis, documentation, and reuse of audiovisual research data.

## Who is it for? 

Transcribing audio or video recordings involves the processing of personal data. To ensure compliance with privacy and data protection regulations, transcription services must be covered by appropriate contractual agreements.

Amberscript can be used by researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam who need to transcribe audio or video recordings as part of their research data workflow.

Amberscript has a blanket data processing agreement in place with Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. This allows researchers to upload and transcribe research data containing personal data without having to arrange individual data processing agreements. As a result, transcription work can begin immediately, as data protection requirements have already been addressed at the institutional level.

## What does it do? 

Amberscript converts speech in audio or video files into text. As transcription involves personal data, Amberscript is approved for use at VU through an institutional data processing agreement, allowing researchers to use the service without arranging individual contracts.

### Transcription options:

Amberscript offers several transcription options, allowing researchers to choose the level of detail appropriate for their research purpose:

- **Automated transcription** – fast, software-based transcription that can be edited by the researcher  
- **Verbatim transcription** – clean text without hesitations or pauses  
- **Literal transcription** – detailed transcription including hesitations and silences, suitable for research and legal use

### Choosing the appropriate transcription type

The choice of transcription method depends on the research design, analytical needs, and available budget. When transcripts are not used as primary data, automated or verbatim transcription may be sufficient. When transcripts constitute the research data itself, for example in linguistic, legal, or psychological studies, literal transcription is recommended. Automated transcription may still be used in such cases, provided that transcripts are carefully reviewed and corrected by the researcher.

## Access

Amberscript offers both automated transcription and transcription carried out by professional transcribers. Automated transcription is available through prepaid credits per hour of audio. For verbatim or literal transcription by transcribers, a quote must be requested in advance.
