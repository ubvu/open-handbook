title: Data Transportation and Transfer

It is important to protect your data during the entire data life cycle. To find out whether your data are secure during all stages of your research, think about your data flow: where do your data originate and where do they go to? If data need to be transported from one physical place to the other, from one storage platform to another, or  from one device to another, these actions should happen in a secure way.

### Transferring digital data

#### Data collection on campus

If data collection takes place through a certain measurement device (e.g. MRI scanner, EEG scanner, eye tracker), the data need to be transferred from the measurement device to the storage location that you will use during your research project. The best way to do this is to write the data directly to [SciStor](./scistor.qmd). Please contact [IT for Research](./itvo.qmd) for advice. 

Sometimes it is not possible to write the data to a storage platform, for example if there is no way to connect to the campus network. Make sure that this transfer takes place in a secure way and also make a plan for the data on the measurement device. Make sure important data is backed up and find out whether data stored on the instruments itself should be deleted. 

#### Data collection outside campus (online)

If you are doing fieldwork outside the campus and you have reliable and secure internet access, it is a good idea to upload the data to a storage location that is regularly backed up and secure, in order to prevent data loss. All the VU-supported [storage solutions](./data-storage.qmd) are suitable, some of them also allow access for external collaborators.

#### Data collection outside campus (offline)
If you are doing fieldwork in an area with limited internet access, you might use a portable device to initially store your data, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive. Make sure to keep at least 2 copies of the data (for example your laptop + a USB drive or 2 USB drives). As soon as you are in a place with an internet connection you can upload the data to a secure [storage space](./data-storage.qmd).

Please make sure that the data on portable devices is secured, by using encryption (and by transporting them safely by using a lockable briefcase or backpack). You can [request](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=73eaf6e147264150bfa46d72e36d43d6) encrypted USB drives from IT, your VU laptop is always encrypted.

### Transferring large amounts of data


### Transporting physical data

If physical objects need to be transported, you should check with the data manager at your department (if available) what options are available. Special briefcases that can be locked or secure backpacks may need to be used to keep informed consent forms or other sensitive data objects (USB drives etc.) secure during transport. A checklist may help to ensure all objects will be taken along.

### Data transportation and transfer across borders

Some countries have rules to control the movement of encryption technology that enter or exit their borders. If you need to travel with an encrypted laptop to secure your data, for example during fieldwork abroad, please keep this in mind. If you need to transfer data in and out of such countries, please get advice on encryption and secure transportation at the [IT Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk.it@vu.nl).

### Sending data
A storage platform that allows collaboration is the easiest way to share data, but sometimes you might need to send data to a third party as a one-off. Regular email is not suitable for sending sensitive data, but there are alternatives:

**Zivver**
**SURFfilesender**

### Support
If you have general questions about how to protect your data when transporting or transferring them, you can contact the [IT Service Desk](mailto:servicedesk.it@vu.nl). 

In case of complex situations please ask 


Such a plan is usually based on documents which need to be completed beforehand, like a [Data Protection Impact Assessment](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/guides/plan-and-design.html#what-is-a-dpia) and a [Data Classification](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/guides/plan-and-design.html#data-classification).
