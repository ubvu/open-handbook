## Open Science Framework (OSF) Workshop

This is a hands-on course to get started with the Open Science Framework (OSF). You won't need any experience with the tool beforehand. We will show the differences and similarities between OSF and other tools at the VU (such as Yoda). We will make a preregistration of a (mock) OSF research.

The OSF is an open-source project management tool that supports researchers throughout their entire project lifecycle. As a collaboration tool, OSF helps research teams work on projects privately or make the whole project publicly accessible for broad dissemination. As a workflow system, OSF enables connections to the many scientific tools researchers already use, streamlining their process and increasing efficiency. You may even use OSF as a portfolio tool for sharing your work as a prepublication with potential collaborators.

## Open Science against Humanity

This card game is based on "Cards Against Humanity" and teaches basic concepts of Open Science, Research Data Management, Software Management, FAIR principles, and Research Ethics in a fun and entertaining way. The white cards describe research related situations or statements relevant for researchers. The black cards contain potential answers or prompts that have a connection to Open Science. The goal of the game is to pair the white cards (prompts) and the black cards in the funniest, most provocative, or smartest way you can. Playing the card game online or with a physical deck creates awareness of issues around resesarch practices and allows for discussions around Open Science.

## Open loves Science

Open Science aims to improve, streamline and elevate science to something bigger. Why? Out of love for science of course!

In Open loves Science, players are invited to engage in playful and deep conversations about Open Science. The card game features an encyclopedia of issues that pervade this movement of research reform and ask participants to consider their role and values in changing academic culture. Like Open Science, this game is about connection. Players are meant to look into each other's eyes, engage in conversation, and better understand one another.

"Open loves Science" was made for the Data love week 2024.
