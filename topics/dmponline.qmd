## What is it?

DMPonline is an online platform that enables researchers to create, manage, and share [Data Management Plans](../topics/data-management-plan.qmd) (DMPs). VU Amsterdam offers [DMPonline](https://dmponline.vu.nl/) as the institutional online tool for writing Data Management Plans. The platform provides structured templates to help researchers address data collection, legal and ethical requirements, storage, preservation, documentation, and responsibilities and resources throughout the research lifecycle.

## What can it be used for?

DMPonline can be used for:

- **Writing Data Management Plans**: Create comprehensive DMPs that meet funder and institutional requirements, using guidance in the tool that supports the writing process.
- **Collaborative planning**: Work together with colleagues, data stewards, and other stakeholders on DMP development.
- **Feedback and review**: Request feedback from faculty data stewards or RDM Support Desk colleagues.
- **VU DMP template**: Use the VU DMP template to write a comprehensive DMP (accepted by NWO, ZonMw and ERC).
- **Export function**: Export DMPs in different formats that can be submitted to funders or other stakeholders.
- **GDPR registration**: Register personal data processing activities to comply with VU Amsterdam's GDPR requirements. You can read how to do this in the guide [How can you comply with the GDPR?](https://rdm.vu.nl/guides/comply-with-gdpr.html#register-your-processing-activities).
