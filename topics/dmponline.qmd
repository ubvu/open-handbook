## What is it?

DMPonline is an online platform that enables researchers to create, manage, and share [Data Management Plans](../topics/data-management-plan.qmd) (DMPs). VU Amsterdam offers [DMPonline](https://dmponline.vu.nl/) as the institutional online tool for writing Data Management Plans. The platform provides structured templates to help researchers address data collection, legal and ethical requirements, storage, preservation, documentation, and responsibilities and resources throughout the research lifecycle.
