## Welcome

ADA is the high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), it serves as the successor to the BAZIS cluster and is managed by the IT for Research team.

::: {.callout-note title="New here? Start with these first."}
- Request an account via the ðŸ”’ [VU Service Portal](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=83139c79473e8150bfa46d72e36d432e). 
- New to bash and the command line? Get familiar with Linux basics first through [Carpentries lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
- Set-up your SSH access by following the [login instructions](getting-started/login.qmd).
- New to HPC? Get familiar with HPC concepts through [HPC Carpentries lessons](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/).
- Read the onboarding guide in [HPC 101](getting-started/hpc-101.qmd).
- Run your first job with the [Quick Start](quick-start.qmd).

## ADA at a Glance

- Heterogeneous cluster with CPU and GPU partitions financed by VU departments and central IT.
- Access to partitions depends on departmental ownership; community partitions are available to all approved users.
- Software stack combines centrally maintained [modules](getting-started/software.qmd) with self-service tools (Pixi, Conda, Apptainer).
- Data on [SciStor](../topics/SciStor.qmd) is mounted directly on ADA.
- For workloads demanding large GPU quotas, explore [Snellius](../topics/snellius.qmd) or work with your department on dedicated nodes.

## Access, Policies, and Costs

- **Eligibility**: VU researchers and collaborators whose departments sponsor ADA hardware or are approved for community access.
- **Requesting access**: follow the [account request instructions](../topics/ada.qmd#how-to-request-access); requests must include your supervisorâ€™s approval.
- **Usage costs**: Community partitions are free to use but shared; heavy or specialised workloads may require investing in departmental nodes.
- **Dedicated hardware**: Contact [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl) to scope dedicated purchases or long-term resource planning.

## When ADA Fits Your Work

Use ADA when you need more resources than a laptop or workstation: multi-core CPUs, large memory nodes, or batch GPU capacity. Jobs must run from the Linux command line in non-interactive modeâ€”graphical tools require alternatives such as the [VU Compute Hub](https://hub.compute.vu.nl/) or [SURF Research Cloud](../topics/researchcloud.qmd).

## Training and External Resources

- **SURF Snellius wiki**: [Snellius knowledge base](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius) â€“ much of it applies to ADA.
- **Workshops**: SURFâ€™s free [Introduction to Supercomputing](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda) courses provides transferable skills for ADA users.

## Support

- Technical questions, quota requests, or procurement discussions: [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl)
- Strategic advice on fit for purpose: contact your facultyâ€™s research IT coordinator or the IT for Research helpdesk.
