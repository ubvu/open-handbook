## Welcome

ADA is the high-performance computing (HPC) cluster for researchers at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Named after [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), it serves as the successor to the BAZIS cluster and is managed by the IT for Research team.

::: {.callout-note title="New here? Start with these first."}
- Request an account via the 🔒 [VU Service Portal](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=83139c79473e8150bfa46d72e36d432e). 
- New to bash and the command line? Get familiar with Linux basics first through [Carpentries lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
- Set-up your SSH access by following the [login instructions](./login.qmd).
- New to HPC? Get familiar with HPC concepts through [HPC Carpentries lessons](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/).
- Run your first job with the [Quick Start](quick-start.qmd).

## ADA at a Glance

- [Heterogeneous cluster](./hardware.qmd) with CPU and GPU partitions financed by VU departments and central IT.
- Access to partitions depends on departmental ownership; community partitions are available to all approved users.
- [Software stack](./software.qmd) combines centrally maintained modules with self-service tools (Pixi, Conda, Apptainer).
- Data on [SciStor](../../topics/scistor.qmd) is mounted directly on ADA.
- For workloads demanding large GPU quotas, explore [Snellius](../../topics/snellius.qmd) or work with your department on dedicated nodes.

## Access, Policies, and Costs

- **Eligibility**: VU researchers and collaborators whose departments sponsor ADA hardware or are approved for community access.
- **Requesting access**: follow the [account request instructions](../../topics/ada.qmd#how-to-request-access); requests must include your supervisor’s approval.
- **Usage costs**: Community partitions are free to use but shared; heavy or specialised workloads may require investing in departmental nodes.
- **Dedicated hardware**: Contact [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl) to scope dedicated purchases or long-term resource planning.

## When ADA Fits Your Work

Use ADA when you need more resources than a laptop or workstation: multi-core CPUs, large memory nodes, or batch GPU capacity. Jobs must run from the Linux command line in non-interactive mode—graphical tools require alternatives such as the [VU Compute Hub](https://hub.compute.vu.nl/) or [SURF Research Cloud](../../topics/researchcloud.qmd).

## Training and External Resources

- **SURF Snellius wiki**: [Snellius knowledge base](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius) – much of it applies to ADA.
- **Workshops**: SURF’s free [Introduction to Supercomputing](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda) courses provides transferable skills for ADA users.

## Support

- Technical questions, quota requests, or procurement discussions: [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl)
- Issues using the cluster? See [Help](help.qmd) to see how to ask for assistance effectively.

## Documentation Feedback

- Found a typo, missing page, or confusing section? Please open an issue in the handbook’s issue tracker with:
  - Page path (for example `manuals/ada/software.qmd`) and what needs to change
  - A suggested fix or the exact text that confused you
  - Optional: a PR if you already made the change

If you prefer, you can also email [itvo.it@vu.nl] with the same details and we will triage it.

## Maintainers

The cluster has been built and is maintained by:

* Davor Cvikic
* Kostas Vilkelis
* Wiebe J.R. Timmers
