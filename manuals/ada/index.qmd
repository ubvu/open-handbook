## Welcome

ADA is named in honour of [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the pioneering mathematician and writer known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. ADA is the rebranded name of our previous cluster, BAZIS, and is maintained by the IT for Research team.
