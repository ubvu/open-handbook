title: About ADA
---

ADA is named in honour of Ada Lovelace, the pioneering mathematician and writer known for her work on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. ADA is the rebranded name of our previous cluster, BAZIS, and is maintained by the IT for Research team.

## At a Glance

- [Heterogeneous cluster](./hardware.qmd) with CPU and GPU partitions financed by VU departments and central IT.
- Access to partitions depends on departmental ownership; community partitions are available to all approved users.
- [Software stack](./software.qmd) combines centrally maintained modules with self-service tools (Pixi, Conda, Apptainer).
- Data on [SciStor](/topics/scistor.qmd) is mounted directly on ADA.
- For workloads demanding large GPU quotas, explore [Snellius](/topics/snellius.qmd) or work with your department on dedicated nodes.

## Access, Policies, and Costs

- **Eligibility**: VU researchers and collaborators whose departments sponsor ADA hardware or are approved for community access.
- **Requesting access**: follow the [account request instructions](../../topics/ada.qmd#how-to-request-access); requests must include your supervisor’s approval.
- **Usage costs**: Community partitions are free to use but shared; heavy or specialised workloads may require investing in departmental nodes.
- **Dedicated hardware**: Contact [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl) to scope dedicated purchases or long-term resource planning.

## When ADA Fits Your Work

Use ADA when you need more resources than a laptop or workstation: multi-core CPUs, large memory nodes, or batch GPU capacity. Jobs must run from the Linux command line in non-interactive mode—graphical tools require alternatives such as the [VU Compute Hub](https://hub.compute.vu.nl/) or [SURF Research Cloud](../../topics/researchcloud.qmd).


## Training and External Resources

- **SURF Snellius wiki**: [Snellius knowledge base](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius) – much of it applies to ADA.
- **Workshops**: SURF’s free [Introduction to Supercomputing](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda) courses provides transferable skills for ADA users.
- **HPC Course VU**: Once a year, the VU organizes the [HPC Course](https://vu.nl/en/education/phd-courses/hpc-course). All ADA users will be notified when registration opens. 

## Support

- Technical questions, quota requests, or procurement discussions: [IT for Research](mailto:itvo.it@vu.nl)
- Issues using the cluster? See [Help](help.qmd) to see how to ask for assistance effectively.

## Documentation Feedback

- Found a typo, missing page, or confusing section? Please open an issue in the handbook’s issue tracker with:
  - Page path (for example `manuals/ada/software.qmd`) and what needs to change
  - A suggested fix or the exact text that confused you
  - Optional: a PR if you already made the change

If you prefer, you can also email [itvo.it@vu.nl] with the same details and we will triage it.
