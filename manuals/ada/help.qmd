## Before You Ask

::: {.callout-warning title="Start here"}
- Read the ADA manual sections relevant to your issue first.
- You are expected to know basic Bash and HPC concepts. See: [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) and [HPC Introduction](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/).
- For software management options, consult [Software on ADA](./software.qmd).
:::

## Scope and Expectations

What we support:

- ADA‑specific issues (login/access problems, scheduler anomalies on ADA, storage mount issues, module stack problems, etc), and suggestions that improve ADA for many users.

What we do not support:

- Software installs: we do not take one‑off install requests unless they benefit the broader ADA user base. Use modules, Pixi, Conda, or Apptainer for project‑specific stacks.
- Out of scope: teaching programming, Bash, or SLURM basics; debugging your research code; building bespoke environments for a single project. Use the linked learning resources and upstream documentation.

## How to Submit a Good Ticket

Submit via the 🔒 VU Service Portal or email [itvo.it@vu.nl]. Include a clear subject and the details below.

```
Summary
  Short description of the problem.

What I tried
  Exact commands run (copy/paste), scripts used, and any changes recently made.

Expected vs. actual
  What you expected to happen, and what happened instead.

Reproduction steps (minimal)
  Smallest example that fails, with steps someone else can run.

Context
  - Login or node hostnames involved
  - Partition/QoS used
  - Job IDs: <jobid1>, <jobid2>
  - Software method: modules / Pixi / Conda / Apptainer
  - Relevant versions (e.g., `module list`, `pixi --version`, `conda --version`, `apptainer --version`)

Artifacts (attach as files or paste snippets)
  - SLURM script (`.sbatch`) and job output (slurm-<jobid>.out)
  - Command output and full error messages
  - `module list` output inside the job
  - If using containers: image name, how it was built, and the `apptainer exec ...` command
```
:::

## Helpful Diagnostics

Include small, relevant command output instead of screenshots where possible:

- Queue/accounting excerpts for the affected jobs (`squeue`, `sacct`).
- The exact `sbatch` script and `slurm-<jobid>.out` content.
- `module list` inside the job environment, or your Pixi/Conda environment details.

## Documentation Feedback

- Found a typo, missing page, or confusing section? Please open an issue in the handbook’s issue tracker with:
  - Page path (for example `manuals/ada/software.qmd`) and what needs to change
  - A suggested fix or the exact text that confused you
  - Optional: a PR if you already made the change

If you prefer, you can also email [itvo.it@vu.nl] with the same details and we will triage it.
