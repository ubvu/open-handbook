## What it is

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a browser-based portal for launching interactive sessions on ADA without local SSH setup. It provides web terminals, a file browser, and ready-made apps such as RStudio, JupyterLab, and VS Code.

- Portal: https://ondemand.labs.vu.nl
- Access: available on campus or via the VU VPN.
- Scheduler: all sessions run as SLURM jobs on compute nodes.

## Resources and persistence

::: {.callout-important title="Choose resources explicitly"}
For every session you must request resources: partition, CPUs, memory, and walltime. The scheduler will start your app when suitable nodes are available.
:::

- Sessions keep running until the requested walltime expires, even if you close the browser tab or switch computers. Reconnect from “My Interactive Sessions”.
- Please stop sessions when finished to free resources for others.

## System apps (RStudio, JupyterLab, VS Code)

1. Open the OOD portal and click the app icon (for example RStudio, JupyterLab, or VS Code).
2. Fill in the resource form: partition/queue, CPUs, memory, walltime (and any optional parameters).
3. Click “Launch”. OOD submits a job; when it starts, click “Connect”.
4. Return later via “My Interactive Sessions” to reconnect, or “Stop” to end early.

Notes:

- File access mirrors your cluster home and project storage.
- If a session stays queued, reduce resources or select another partition; consult the SLURM page for tips.

## Custom software via Apptainer (optional)

If you need a custom RStudio Server or JupyterLab environment, package it as an Apptainer (`.sif`) image and point the app to your image at launch.

- Build the image locally or on ADA (compute nodes) following the Apptainer docs and our container guidance: see [Apptainer Containers](software.qmd#apptainer-containers).
- In the OOD app form, select the Apptainer image" option and browse to your `.sif` in your home directory.
- Test the image on a compute node before using it in OOD:
  ```sh
  apptainer exec /path/to/your.sif jupyter-lab --version
  ```

## Develop your own OOD apps (advanced)

User app development is enabled. You can create and publish your own interactive apps for your projects.

- Follow the official guide: https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/
- For inspiration, inspect the definitions of the system apps installed on ADA. These are located on the `inter04` node under `/var/www/ood/apps/sys/` path (`jupyter` and `rstudio_server` folders).


::: {.callout-warning title="No app requests"}
We do not build or maintain user-specific OOD apps. You are responsible for your app definitions and containers.

## Troubleshooting

- Session stuck in “Queued/Pending”: your request doesn’t fit current availability. Try a different partition or smaller CPU/memory/walltime; see [SLURM](slurm.qmd).
- Session reports errors: open the job output/logs from the session card, and include those when requesting help.
- Need to reconnect: go to “My Interactive Sessions” and click “Connect”. Sessions persist until walltime.
