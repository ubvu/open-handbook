This page provides instructions on how to request software installs for the ADA software stack.

You can request software installs through the [VU IT Serviceportal ticket submit page](https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=3f1dd0320a0a0b99000a53f7604a2ef9). Please mention ADA in the subject, 
so our colleagues from the central IT department know where to transfer the ticket to. 

## üìù Ticket Template (Markdown)
Copy the block below into your ticket and fill out all 3 sections. 


```markdown
### 1. Software (Package) Name 
Full name and version. 

### 2. Usefull links
E.g. PyPi link, Github link. Also check if your software is listed here: (https://docs.easybuild.io/version-specific/supported-software/). 

### 3. Dependencies
If your request involves Python or R packages, please specify the version you would like the package to be installed . 
(e.g. by mentioning 'latest' , Python 3.12.3 or R 4.4.1 etc. Also see 'module spider Python' to check all available versions on the cluster).

If your request involves a software build from source, we will build on a zen3 architecture by default. If that is not sufficient for your partition/nodes, please let us know if you wish to have it compiled on a specific architecture. 
Also provide us with a list of dependencies if necessary (e.g. if that is not clear from the github repo). 

As of 2025, we also support and encourage users to make use of containers to install software themselves by using apptainer.
