This page explains how to use WebDrive software, on Windows, to access your data via the Yoda WebDAV interface. 

Windows users can use [WebDrive](https://webdrive.com/) to access their data,
as an alternative to the [native WebDAV client](./yoda_using_windowsexplorer.qmd). 
With WebDrive the Yoda WebDAV interface can be connected via as a drive in 
Windows Explorer. 

As a VU user you can download a licensed version of WebDrive from [download.vu.nl](https://download.vu.nl).

Note that you should always [disable caching](#disable-the-cache) in WebDrive!

## Using WebDrive

Start Webdrive from the Desktop icon or the Start menu.

You can click Test Connection to see if the credentials are correct.

You should now see the Yoda Disk in your Windows Explorer.

## Disable the cache
By default WebDrive enables a caching mechanism and suggests this as a way to enable syncing and working offline.   
This functionality is not implemented very well and you should **always disable** this to prevent data loss.
