This page explains how to use Rclone software, on Windows, MacOS or Linux, to access your data via the Yoda WebDAV interface. 

[Rclone](https://rclone.org/) is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. 
It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. 
Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, 
as well as standard transfer protocols.

Rclone is available for Linux, Mac and Windows, see [https://rclone.org/downloads/](https://rclone.org/downloads/) 

You can use rclone to access the Yoda drive using WebDAV.

Note: if you are on Linux and comfortable with commandline tools, the [iRODS icommands](./yoda_using_icommands.qmd) provide better performance.

## Create a config
Rclone always expects you to create a config first:
```
rclone config
```
You will be led through a number of questions

n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote

## Updating the Data Access Password
A Yoda [Data Access Password](./yoda_dap.qmd) is only valid for a set amount of time. Once it has expired you should generate a new one. Run `rclone config`, choose `e) Edit existing remote` and enter the new DAP in the password section:
```
...

Option pass.

Choose an alternative below. Press Enter for the default (n).
y) Yes, type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No, keep existing (default)
y/g/n> y
```

## Mounting on Windows
Please make sure to use `--vfs-cache-mode`, see (rlone docs)[https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching]

```
.\rclone --vfs-cache-mode full mount yoda:research-staff-ubvu-geoplaza/ y:
```
Will mount the `yoda` config as drive Y.
