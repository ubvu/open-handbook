## How to: Logging in to the Yoda portal.
1. Go to [https://portal.yoda.vu.nl/](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl/)

2. Log in using the "Sign in" button. You will be prompted for your email address. Your user name is your primary email address (in lowercase) from your institution or the email address associated with your eduID.

3. Click Next. You will be forwarded to the familiar login page of your institute or eduID.

VU users: note that instead of the TiQR app you should now use the more user-friendly Azure MFA. Switch by following [this instruction manual](https://vunl.sharepoint.com/sites/CollaborationServices/Identity%20en%20security/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FCollaborationServices%2FIdentity%20en%20security%2FTiqr%20%2D%20MFA%20Manuals%2FAzure%20MFA%20Tiqr%20handleiding%20NL%20%2D%20v4%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FCollaborationServices%2FIdentity%20en%20security%2FTiqr%20%2D%20MFA%20Manuals) 
on the VU SharePoint.

**Note that** VU students might need to visit the Service Desk to enable MFA via SURFsecureID for their student.vu.nl account if they have not done so before. The procedure is explained in [this document on the VU services portal](https://services.vu.nl/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011809).
