title: "Getting started"

Before getting started, a project space must be created and a user account must be added by the Yoda administrator. Only then is access to Yoda granted.

Although Yoda employs a user’s VUnetID for single sign-on (SSO) authentication and identification, users are required to log in using their primary email address.
The [Yoda Topic page](/topics/yoda.html#how-to-request-access){target="_blank"} explains how to request storage space in Yoda for your project.
 
This Manual will further provide an overview of the Yoda functionality you can access through the [Yoda Web Portal](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl).
