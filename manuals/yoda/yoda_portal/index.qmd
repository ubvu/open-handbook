title: "Getting started: Yoda Portal"
---

This page provides an overview of the Yoda functionality you can access through the [Yoda Web Portal](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl).
Before getting started, a project space must be created and a user account moet be added by the Yoda administrator before a user has access to Yoda. Whilst Yoda leverages on a user’s VUnetId as an authentication and identification mechanism, single sign-on (SSO), users should always use their primary e-mail address to login to the system.
