Yoda uses a notification system to notify you when the status of a data package that was submitted for [archiving](/manuals/yoda/securing_distribution/vault_archive.qmd) or [publishing](/manuals/yoda/securing_distribution/vault_publish.qmd) changes.

If you have unread notifications a Bell sign will be visible next to your email address on the top right button. You can view notifications by clicking on the Notifications button.
