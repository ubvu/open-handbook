This page provides guidance on how to add metadata to your datasets in Yoda.

## Metadata in Yoda

Metadata is &ldquo;data about data&rdquo;. Metadata serves multiple purposes in Yoda, the most important being:

- To describe the contents of a dataset for a broad audience.
- To inform the audience whether the data can be reused and if so, under what conditions.
- To prescribe how the data should be cited and whom to acknowledge.
- To inform digital archivists and IT staff about how long the data should be retained.
- To facilitate finding the dataset in data catalogues.

We distinguish two types of metadata:

**Structured metadata** consists of information that is standardized globally and used by data catalogs.
Examples are the title of the data package, its creator, the retention period of the package, etc.

When a data package is published, Yoda makes the structured metadata available for harvesting by data catalogs, such as [DataCite](https://search.datacite.org/).

**Unstructured metadata** is intended to provide more detailed information about the data. This information can be in a 
README.TXT or other file that is included as part of the data package. The format of this file is chosen by the
researcher. Users will need to open and inspect the data package to find this metadata. Unstructured metadata can 
include information about (for example) the experimental design, data transformation, sampling method, etc.

## Adding metadata in Yoda

Yoda facilitates adding both structured and unstructured metadata to your research data. Entering structured metadata 
is a prerequisite for archiving a data package. If a folder is published, its structured metadata will be published as well
and can be harvested by data catalogs such as [DataCite](https://search.datacite.org/). Your published 
datasets can also be registered in [Pure](https://research.vu.nl).

In order to add structured metadata to a folder, navigate to the folder in the Yoda portal and press the 
&ldquo;Metadata&rdquo; button.

![Add-metadata](/public/manuals/yoda/add-metadata.png)

Once you have added metadata and clicked on the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button, the metadata will be stored in a specific 
format in the folder. Yoda uses files named &ldquo;yoda-metadata.json&rdquo; for this purpose.

Unstructured metadata can be added as a file to the dataset, for example in a &ldquo;Readme.txt&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;Codebook.pdf&rdquo; file.

## The metadata form

By default, the Yoda metadata form consists of approximately 30 fields. 
Please consult the metadata element list below for a detailed description of the elements.

All mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk.

![Mandatory metadata](/public/manuals/yoda/mandatory-metadata.png)

Some metadata elements consist of multiple fields. For example, if you enter a person identifier, you should also 
specify the type of identifier.
![Compound metadata](/public/manuals/yoda/compound-metadata.png)

Some fields can have multiple values. In order to add a value, press the &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign next to the field.

## Reusing metadata

Structured metadata is reusable. The metadata form includes a button &ldquo;Clone from parent folder&rdquo;. One way to 
use this feature is to create a project-level folder with several subfolders for data. Common metadata elements for the 
project can be entered in the project-level folder. This metadata can then be copied to the data folders and filled in further.

You can also copy the &ldquo;yoda-metadata.json&rdquo; file of a folder to another folder in order to copy its metadata.

When you publish a folder, only the metadata on the level of that folder is published in data catalogs.

For instance, you can indicate that the current   data package (A) contains the raw data upon which the related data package (B) is based by selecting *IsSourceOf* in this field and entering the information of the other data package in the fields below. You can have multiple *Related data packages* &mdash; use the plus sign to add more values. |

| 20a  | Contributor to Data Package - Name | R | The institution or person responsible for collecting, managing, distributing, or otherwise contributing to the development of the resource.<br>For software, if there is an alternate entity that "holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces" the code, use the contributor Type "hostingInstitution" for the code repository. | Contributors are not listed as creators when the data package is cited. Contributors are analogous to co-creators that would appear in the Acknowledgements-section of a manuscript. Multiple values possible &mdash; use the plus sign to add more values. Maximum length: 255 characters. |
| 20b | Contributor to Data Package - Type | R if 20a | Enter what type of contribution the registered person has had to this   data package. | See [the datacite documentation](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#7a-contributortype) for explanation.  |
| 20c | Contributor to Data Package - Affiliation name| M if 20a | The organizational or institutional   affiliation of the contributor. | Example: &ldquo;Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam&rdquo;. The affiliation of the creator of a data package could be of importance  when it is unclear who owns the data. In general the organization to which   the creator was affiliated is regarded as the owner. Each creator can have multiple affiliations &mdash; use the plus sign to add more values. Most research institutes should be in the list and the ROR identifier will automatically filled. If the institution is not in the list, use the Find button, you can leave the ROR field empty in case the institute does not have a ROR.  Maximum length: 255 characters.
| 20d | Contributor to Data Package - Affiliation identifier| R | The organizational or institutional   identifier of the contributor. | It is recommended to use the resolvable URL from the [Research Organization Registry (ROR)](https://ror.org/search).

| 21  | License | M | The license under which you offer the data package for use by third   parties. The preferred value for open data is [CC By 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). | Every package needs to be archived with a license &mdash; even when you’re not   planning to publish the data or have it reused in any form.       We offer a number of possible licenses in a drop-down list. If you do not   know which license to choose, contact the data manager.   At the moment of publishing a data package the relevant license text will   be copied into the data package. If you opt for a custom license, you will need to store the custom   license text in a file titled *License.txt*   in the root folder. If the *Data Package Access (22)* is *Restricted Access* or *Closed Access*, you can only opt for a custom license, the VU has created [custom templates for the License.txt file](./yoda_workflow_metadata_license.qmd).
| 22  | Data Package Access | M | Once archived, should your dataset be  accessible to third parties? | *Open Access* means that the dataset is accessible to everyone.  *Restricted Access* means that the dataset can only be obtained on request. *Closed Access* means that the dataset cannot be shared, in principle.
