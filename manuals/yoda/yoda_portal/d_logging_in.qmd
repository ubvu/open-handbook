## How to: Logging in to the Yoda portal.
1. Go to [https://portal.yoda.vu.nl/](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl/)

3. Click Next. You will be forwarded to the familiar login page of your institute or eduID.

VU users: note that instead of the TiQR app you should now use the more user-friendly Azure MFA. Switch by following [this instruction manual](https://vunl.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Collaboration-Services/Identity%20and%20security/Tiqr%20-%20MFA%20Manuals?csf=1&web=1&e=KhnHHc) 
on the VU SharePoint.

**Note that** VU students might need to visit the Service Desk to enable MFA via SURFsecureID for their student.vu.nl account if they have not done so before. The procedure is explained in [this document on the VU services portal](https://services.vu.nl/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011809).
