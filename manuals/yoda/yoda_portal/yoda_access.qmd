This page explains how to accept a Yoda SRAM invitation and how to log in.

## Invitation to Yoda collaboration
After you are added to a Yoda group by the admin or a colleague you will receive an invitation to join a Yoda "collaboration" in SRAM ([SURF Research Access Management](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/surf-research-access-management)). The "join" link in the invitation will lead you to SRAM. 

- If you have not logged in to SRAM before with your browser you will see the following screen where you can search for your institute:

- Click on the name to be redirected to your familiar institutional login page.

- If your institute is not in this list or if you are not affiliated with a research or education organisation please choose **eduID (NL)**. If you do not yet have an eduID you can create one for free, the system will lead you through the process. More information on eduID here: https://www.eduid.nl/

Click Next. You will be forwarded to the familiar login page of your institute or eduID.

VU users: note that instead of the TiQR app you should now use the 
more user-friendly Azure MFA. Switch by following [this instruction manual](https://vunl.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Collaboration-Services/Identity%20and%20security/Tiqr%20-%20MFA%20Manuals?csf=1&web=1&e=KhnHHc) 
on the VU SharePoint.

**VU Students** might need to visit the Service Desk to enable MFA via SURFsecureID for their student.vu.nl account if they have not done so before. The procedure is explained in [this document on the VU services portal](https://services.vu.nl/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011809).
