Windows users can use [WebDrive](https://webdrive.com/) to access their data,
as an alternative to the [native WebDAV client](./yoda_using_windowsexplorer.qmd). 
With WebDrive the Yoda WebDAV interface can be connected via as a drive in 
Windows Explorer. 

As a VU user you can download a licensed version of WebDrive from [download.vu.nl](https://download.vu.nl).

Note that you should always [disable caching](#disable-the-cache) in WebDrive!

## Using WebDrive

Start Webdrive from the Desktop icon or the Start menu.

Enter `https://data.yoda.vu.nl/` in the Url/Address field.

Enter the Username (an emailaddress). Create a [data access password](/manuals/yoda/data_access/yoda_dap.qmd) and copy it to the Password field.

You can click Test Connection to see if the credentials are correct. 

Click Next

You should now see the Yoda Disk in your Windows Explorer.

## Disable the cache
By default WebDrive enables a caching mechanism and suggests this as a way to enable syncing and working offline.   
This functionality is not implemented very well and you should **always disable** this to prevent data loss.
