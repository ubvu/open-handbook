## How to: Adding metadata in Yoda

Yoda facilitates adding both structured and unstructured metadata to your research data. Entering structured metadata 
is a prerequisite for archiving a data package. If a folder is published, its structured metadata will be published as well
and can be harvested by data catalogs such as [DataCite](https://search.datacite.org/). Your published 
datasets can also be registered in [Pure](https://research.vu.nl).

In order to add structured metadata to a folder:
1. navigate to the folder in the Yoda portal and press the 
&ldquo;Metadata&rdquo; button.

2. Once you have added metadata and clicked on the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button, the metadata will be stored in a specific 
format in the folder. Yoda uses files named &ldquo;yoda-metadata.json&rdquo; for this purpose.

3. Unstructured metadata can be added as a file to the dataset, for example in a &ldquo;Readme.txt&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;Codebook.pdf&rdquo; file.

## The metadata form

By default, the Yoda metadata form consists of approximately 30 fields. 
Please consult the metadata element list below for a detailed description of the elements.

All mandatory fields are marked with an asterisk.

Some metadata elements consist of multiple fields. For example, if you enter a person identifier, you should also 
specify the type of identifier.

Some fields can have multiple values. In order to add a value, press the &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign next to the field.

## Reusing metadata

Structured metadata is reusable. The metadata form includes a button &ldquo;Clone from parent folder&rdquo;. One way to 
use this feature is to create a project-level folder with several subfolders for data. Common metadata elements for the 
project can be entered in the project-level folder. This metadata can then be copied to the data folders and filled in further.

You can also copy the &ldquo;yoda-metadata.json&rdquo; file of a folder to another folder in order to copy its metadata.

When you publish a folder, only the metadata on the level of that folder is published in data catalogs.
