This page provides an overview of the 3 main ways to transfer data to and from Yoda.

Note that creating a data access password is necessary to transfer data from and to Yoda.
You can transfer files to and from Yoda dependent on the size of the file: 

- Via the Yoda Portal, upload via Drag & Drop, download inviduals files.

This method works fine if you need to upload small amounts of data. 

- For transferring larger amounts of data (tens of GB) it is better to use the WebDAV interface.

There are several methods to access Yoda data via WebDAV, they depend on the Operating System you are using:

  * [Accessing Yoda data on Windows](./yoda_data_windows.qmd)
  * [MacOS](./yoda_data_macos.qmd)
  * [Linux](./yoda_data_linux.qmd)

Note that performance of WebDAV is limited, especially when transferring a large amount of files. 

- For transferring large amounts of date (>100GB) consider using direct access to iRODS. 

A direct iRODS connection offers better performance by enabling multi-threaded transfers and the option to compare checksums.

Power users who are comfortable with command line tools can use the [iRODS icommands](yoda_using_icommands.qmd) to
interact with the iRODS backend of Yoda directly.
