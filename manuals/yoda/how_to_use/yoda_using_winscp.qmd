This page explains how to use WinSCP software, on Windows, to access your data via the Yoda WebDAV interface. 

Windows users can use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net) to access their data via the Yoda WebDAV interface,
as an alternative to the [native WebDAV client](./yoda_using_windowsexplorer.qmd). 

WinSCP is an easy-to-use filetransfer tool. It will show your local disk and the remote Yoda folders next to eachother so you can easily drag and drop files from one to the other.

## Installing WinSCP 

The [WinSCP install guide](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/guide_install) explains how to install WinSCP.

## Using WinSCP

Start WinSCP from the Desktop icon or the Start menu.

In the login window, ensure that the file protocol is set to "WebDAV" and encryption is set to "TLS/SSL implicit encryption".
