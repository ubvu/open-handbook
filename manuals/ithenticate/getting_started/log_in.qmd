You can sign in using your VU email address and password. Note that the ‘Sign Up’ option is not available to create an account yourself, as the VU has a campus licence for PhD candidates. You can create an account by contacting the key user iThenticate within your faculty. In the list of [key users](https://libguides.vu.nl/c.php?g=714180&p=5167373) you can find all key users of the faculties.
