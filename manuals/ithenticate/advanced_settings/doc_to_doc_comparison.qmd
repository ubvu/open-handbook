The feature for document-to-document comparison enables you to upload a single primary document for comparison with up to five additional comparison documents. Please note that any documents you upload for document-to-document comparison will remain unindexed and will not be searchable for future submissions.

To utilise the document-to-document comparison feature, navigate to the folders page. From there, go to the "Upload" menu and choose the "Doc-to-Doc Comparison" link. When you access this feature, it will open the document viewer in the "All Sources" view by default. In this view, you'll find a list of all the comparison documents you've uploaded. Each comparison document is accompanied by a percentage, indicating the extent of similarity between its content and the primary document. If a comparison document has no matching text with the primary document, it will display a 0% similarity score next to it.
