## Register your Data in Pure

Just like your publications, data that you have collected for your research constitutes research output, too. Therefore you are required to record your data in [Pure](/topics/pure.qmd).[^1] Your data can be of interest to others, which can in turn lead to new collaboration opportunities. Data recorded in Pure also appear in reports that are used for research evaluations. Even if access to your data is closed, you are required to register your data in Pure. It is a record of the research, data collection and analysis that you have carried out.

### Benefits of recording your data in Pure

* It increases the visibility and findability of your data
* It contributes to re-use and transparency
* It boosts your collaboration opportunities
* It counts towards research evaluations and assessments
