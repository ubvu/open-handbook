  abstract  = "AbstractThere is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure
               supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of
               stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding
               agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to
               design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of
               principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The
               intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to
               enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from
               peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR
               Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of
               machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to
               supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first
               formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the
               rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the
               community.",
