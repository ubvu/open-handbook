The event centered around sprinting to a finish line by refining existing content and ensuring accessibility standards are met.\nKey activities included:\nOverall, the hackathon was a productive session, and the handbook is now in its final stage, with the team preparing for the official launch on &lt;rdm.vu.nl&gt;. In next hackathons, we may focus on splitting existing topics and adding new ones, as our list of idea topics is growing rapidly."

This resulted in 404 errors that the page could not be found.\nWe first observed this issue on Thursday, one day prior to the downtime, in commit 678ff88. We proposed a fix for this issue in #220, before the downtime started."

The fix was proposed at 1.11PM on Thursday, and did not receive the required reviews by the time the downtime happened (reason 1). However, this was a technical administration task and could have been merged immediately, as this supercedes regular review procedures.\n\n\nReason 2\nThe domain specification fix was not immediately merged to allow time to pass and ensure the fix was appropriate upon further reflection. This is because administrator (chartgerink?) both proposed the fix and would also be the one to supercede the “two reviews” requirement. Due to travel, the administrator forgot about it in the morning, and only saw the messages about the downtime at 8PM. At that time, the fix was quickly merged and the downtime resolved."

This is now automated, which ensures that the domain name will not be removed inadvertently when future changes are incorporated.\nHowever, we also learned that critical administration fixes should not be left open for longer than is absolutely necessary. Here it was left open for longer than absolutely necessary due to travel, and a second administrator could have caught this issue sooner. This means we should work towards resilient reporting mechanisms to escalate such critical issues, and build capacity in the editor team to ensure no one person is responsible for merging critical fixes that are already available."

    "title": "First Handbook Hackathon",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On June 27th, 2024, the first hackathon for the Research Support Handbook took place with all the post authors. For this hackathon, we focused on non-GitHub based contributions, to make it as easy as possible to contribute. To make getting started with contributing easier, we created a choose your own adventure game. We document some lessons and clarifications below, in addition to the twelve reported problems and suggested changes.\nThe workshop helped articulate the dynamic relation between topics and pathways. Topics are contained pages around a specific subject; pathways are a collection of topics. This means that pathways include the topics directly and that this content should be up to date at any given time. When topics are changed, pathways are dynamically updated, making sure there are no discrepancies. The only situation where this may not be the case, is when a pathway is still a work in progress and the topics are not yet properly linked.\nPathways will become more efficient to create as we include more topics in the handbook. Given that pathways are primarily collections of topics, this means that there is barely any new content in there, if any at all. As we include more topics (eight at this time), pathways can focus more and more on the structuring of content, and focus less on creating the content itself.\nWith new contributions, contributors surfaced the need to preview the changes to the handbook. We documented two ways to render the handbook for such previews: (1) creating a Pull Request automatically deploys a preview website and (2) running quarto render locally on the code. Option 1 requires no additional software to be installed, but requires some knowledge of GitHub. Option 2 does not require much knowledge of GitHub, but requires the Quarto software to be installed. There was also the note that deploying the handbook using GitHub pages required a change to the URL, which may cause issues when merging the changes back into the main handbook. This highlights that ensuring reliable previews of contributed content is of importance to some contributors to the handbook.\nLastly, the hackathon surfaced many questions and discussions around the collaborative decisions that will need to be made. When does a topic become too long and should it be split up into multiple topics? Can a topic include subtopics? How is the GitHub environment maintained? How much technical expertise is necessary to ensure the content does not go offline? What contributor roles are there and who has which role? How do roles get distributed and can people volunteer for them? This highlights the engagement with the handbook, and we encourage everyone (including ourselves) to generously surface these discussions in issues or in a next hackathon.\nIn summary, the first hackathon is a success! This is the start of the next phase of the handbook journey, moving from design and scaffolding to nurturing and growing the contents. There will be more hackathons, and these will be announced on this blog and on other channels at VU Amsterdam. Until the next one!"

    "title": "Second Handbook Hackathon",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On September 5th, 2024, all authors participated in the second hackathon for the Research Support Handbook. For this hackathon, we focused on quality assurance. Quality assurance is crucial in ensuring that all parties at VU Amsterdam feel confident adopting this evolving, community-led resource as an official university page. Our goal is to migrate the handbook to rdm.vu.nl in the near future, which requires us to everything is in tip-top shape.\nCollectively, we proofread the migrated LibGuide pages. The result of this are seven GitHub issues and nine pull requests for revisions. These include making sure all images are migrated into the handbook, ensuring appropriate page titles, and refining the contribution guide.\nDuring the hackathon, we observed a lot of links in the old LibGuide resource, are broken. We did some much needed maintenance work during the hackathon, given that the Research Support Handbook will replace the LibGuide resource. We identified broken links and replaced them where possible. There is a need to make this a less manual process in the future and will seek out automations to help us maintain the links moving forward. Additionally, there are many internal links that need updating, changing from LibGuide URLs to GitHub pages. We also discovered several links accessible only with university credentials, which we believe detract from the user experience; these links will require special labeling and contextualization.\nThe general sentiment at the end of the hackathon is that there is still lots of work to do. The community standards are manifesting themselves, and it is clear that pathways need more work to be production ready. These discussions surfaced a wish to have more frequent hackathons at this time, until the standards are set and the included content is ready for rdm.vu.nl."

A user manual provides guidance and instructions to users of a tool. User manuals are created to be easily understood by individuals with varying levels of technical knowledge. It can be assumed that most of the tools will already have their own manuals on the suppliers website. We will link to those as much as possible, we don’t want to duplicate information. If you’re interested, you can read more in Issue #416. The Yoda manuals have now been included in the Handbook (the website yoda.vu.nl will be phased out). Manuals on the handbook will be written in the form of a how-to, the aim is to provide guidance for specific tasks “How do I?”. From the basic: “How do I log in” to the more in-depth “How do I use CUDA on ADA”.\nFinally, we also worked on contributing guidelines and categorised the blog posts, introducing a new type of blog post by ITvO:\n\nInstructions for using VSCode to contribute\nUpdated instructions for rendering the Research Support Handbook locally\nIntroduced Blog categories and ITvO Blog"

Editors also help keep the content relevant to the entirety of VU Amsterdam (faculty specific information is not within scope).\nEach editor commits themselves to providing timely reviews of topics, guides, or both.1 This commitment is for a limited time and can be renewed. We also welcome more editors at any time, given that we do not expect all editors to review everything.\nEditors also are responsible for managing time-sensitive merging of Pull Requests on GitHub. Sometimes, we know things have to change on a specific date. To do this, we can schedule PR merges by adding the relevant date in the opening comment of the Pull Request (example; editors can edit comments):\n/schedule YYYY-MM-DD\nAs we go on this journey together, we may assign more specific responsibilities as they emerge."

For example, Dutch archaeologists mostly use DANS Data Stations to deposit and publish their data. Using a repository that is a common choice in your field will make your data more findable for your colleagues and increase the visibility of your work as a researcher. Some of the data repositories most commonly used in the Netherlands include:\n\nDANS Data Stations: a collection of four domain-specific repositories hosted by the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS), an institute of NWO and KNAW (Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen). They have Data Stations for Social Sciences and Humanities, Archaeology, Life Sciences, and Physical and Technical Sciences.

VU researchers are also welcome to deposit their data at DANS Data Stations;\n4TU.ResearchData: a repository for science, engineering and design data hosted by the 4TU Federation. This is a consortium of the four Dutch technical universities: TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, University of Twente and Wageningen University and Research. VU researchers are also welcome to deposit their data at 4TU;\nZenodo: a domain-agnostic research data repository hosted by CERN in Switzerland and funded by the European Commission.

It is also possible to archive GitHub repositories directly into Zenodo, by which you contribute to Open Science by making a snapshot of your code available in its current form and for the long term;\nOSF (Open Science Framework): a data management and research dissemination platform. VU Amsterdam is an institutional member of the OSF, which means that you can sign up (and in) using your VU account by clicking on the Institution Button on the sign in/up pages. You can use the OSF to create registrations and preregistrations for your research, to publish preprints, and publish and share data and documentation. You can also link other repositories such as DataverseNL to your OSF project. The same goes for GitHub and storage options such as Research Drive and Surfdrive. Do be careful about what you connect!

    "text": "Alternative strategies\n\nPublishing your data in a data journal\nInstead of archiving research data in a data repository, you may choose to publish an article about your data collection. This is not necessarily common for all disciplines. Some examples of data journals where you can publish your data and dataset, are:\n\nScientific Data - Nature\nGeoscience Data Journal\nGigascience\nJournal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data\nEarth System Science Data\nJournal of Open Archaeology Data\nJournal of Open Psychology Data\n\n\n\nPublishing your data as supplementary information with your article\nAnother way to make your data available, is to add them as supplementary information with your article in a journal. At first sight, this may seem a practical solution, because the publication and the underlying data in that case appear together as part of a single publication. However, making your data available as a seperate piece of research output has other advantages:\n\nThe dataset will be citable on its own, which also enables you to get acknowledged for the work on your dataset\nDatasets with many files or many different types of files are easier to structure and present in a repository\nYou can assign different levels of accessibility (unrestricted, restricted or closed) if necessary, which is not possible in a publication\nYou don’t transfer copyright of your data publication to the publisher of your article\n\nIf you make your data available through a repository, you can link from your article to your dataset and the other way around, so that you can present them as related research output."

    "text": "Persistent Identifier\nA Persistent Identifier (PID) is a durable reference to a digital dataset, document, website or other object. In the context of research data and software, it is essentially a URL that will never break. By using a Persistent Identifier, you make sure that your dataset will be findable well into the future when it is registered online (for example at DataCite. Another advantage is that it makes a digital object citable.\n\nMultiple PID systems\nThere are multiple PID systems, each with its own particular properties. Examples of widely used PIDs in the research domain include the following.\n\nDOI: A Digital Object Identifier can be used to refer to research data, research software and publications.\nORCiD: An Open Researcher and Contributor ID is used to create a researcher profile with a unique identification number.\nROR: The Research Organization Registry is a global register with persistent identifiers for research institutes.\n\nSee the Persistent Identifier guide of Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed for a more elaborate overview. Apart from widely used domain-agnostic PIDs, there is a wide range of domain-specific unique identifiers that can be used. If you are interested in domain-specific identifiers, it is useful to ask colleagues in your department or discipline.\n\n\nPersistent Identifiers for data and software in repositories\nPersistent Identifiers can be assigned to datasets and software upon their deposit in a repository. In many repositories, this is a DOI. Data repositories are entitled to generate Persistent Identifiers for data and software. This is one of the reasons why archiving and publishing data and software has to be done in a repository. After the process of uploading data or software to a repository, a Persistent Identifier will be generated. Upon publishing the data or software, the DOI is registered online (usually at DataCite when it concerns a dataset).\nSome repositories enable their users to reserve a Persistent Identifier before the publishing process has finished, so that you can include the Persistent Identifier in a publication before the data will be actually published, or to include the Persistent Identifier in a readme file. This is for example possible in Zenodo.\nThe repositories offered by VU Amsterdam, Yoda and DataverseNL provide DOIs for deposited datasets and software.\n\n\nCreating and using an ORCiD\nResearchers can use an ORCiD to identify their research output as their work. You can request an ORCiD yourself. Instructions for setting up an ORCiD and connecting it to your VU research profile in PURE are available in this ORCiD LibGuide. An ORCiD is often asked for when you submit a publication or upload data or software to a repository. You can use your ORCiD record to create a research profile as well.\n\n\nUsing a ROR\nResearchers can use the ROR for VU Amsterdam when filling metadata forms for their research output to show that their work has been created within their employment at VU Amsterdam."

    "text": "Licensing data and software\n\nIntroduction\nA data licence agreement is a legal instrument that lets others know what they can and cannot do with a particular dataset (and any documentation, scripts and metadata that are published with the data - information about software licensing can be found on the software licensing page). It is important to consider what kind of limitations are relevant. Usually, at least the following questions are considered:\n\nCan people make copies or even distribute copies?\nDo others (and you) reusing the dataset need to acknowledge you as the author of the original dataset? (This is called Attribution.)\nDo others (and you) who reuse the dataset and/or make derivatives of the dataset need to share their work under a similar licence? (This is called Share-Alike.)\nCan others (and you) use your dataset commercially? (A restriction on commercial use is called Non-Commercial.)\nCan others (and you) create a new work based on the dataset? (This is called a Derivative.)\n\nThe considerations above are the ‘building blocks’ that Creative Commons licences use. There are also other considerations, and also other licences.\n\n\n\nAn image of open data, made up of public domain icons\n\n\n\n\nReusing existing data\nIf you wish to reuse data collected by others (this could be data you received from for example Statistics Netherlands or from a company, a dataset you have found in an online repository, commonly used databases for which VU Amsterdam has a licence, etc.), make sure that you read the licence or terms of use. Also make sure that you work with the data according to the licence or terms of use. This can mean different things depending on the licence, but common things to consider are for example:\n\ncite the data in an appropriate manner;\ndo not share the data beyond the project/purpose for which you received them;\nshare the outcome of your research based on the data under a similar licence;\nonly use them for scientific purposes (and not for commercial purposes, for example).\n\nIf you have questions about the legal context of using an existing dataset, you can contact the RDM Support Desk or the legal experts at IXA VU.\n\n\nLicensing data\nIf you want to make your data available for other (research) purposes, it is important to apply a licence to it. Without a licence, it is impossible for others to reuse your data without your explicit approval. When you deposit your data in a repository, the repository will usually ask you to select a standard licence, or to create and add a custom licence yourself. If you need help with drawing up licence agreements, you can contact the VU’s legal office.\n\nDataverseNL\nIn DataverseNL you can choose your terms of use when uploading data to the repository. The DataverseNL user guide explains how licensing works in the repository.\n\n\nYoda\nIf you publish your data in Yoda, there is guidance available on how to choose a licence and how to customise licences.\n\n\nOpen Science Framework (OSF)\nIn OSF, you can apply a standard licence to your materials or upload your own custom licence. The OSF user guide explains both options.\n\n\nExternal repositories\nSome data repositories require you to use a certain licence if you want to deposit your data with them. At Dryad, for example, all datasets are published under the terms of Creative Commons Zero to minimise legal barriers and to maximise the impact for research and education. Some funders may also require that you publish the data as open data. Open data are data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike (Open Knowledge International definition).\n\n\n\nAdditional websites and tools:\n\nExplanation about copyrights and licences by a professor from Leiden University (English subtitles available)\nThe Guide to Creative Commons for Scholarly Publishing and Educational Resources by NWO, VSNU and the University and Royal Libraries\nDCC how-to guide on licensing research data, a guide that links to the Creative Commons website, where many terms are explained\nOpen Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)\nEUDAT B2SHARE licence selection wizard, which Pawel Kamocki (et al.) released under an open source licence.1\n\n\n\nLicensing software\nPublishing research software under an appropriate licence is crucial for its accessibility, usability, and further integration into research. Choosing a licence usually happens right when you start developing the software or when you put it in a public repository, rather than when the software is finished and fully baked.\nA software licence states how other people may re-use your code and under which circumstances. For research software, it is recommended (and often required by funders) that licences are as permissible as possible.\nThere are many licences out there; below we list some very frequently used licences in research software. However, if none of these licences fit your case, there are several tools that can help you to choose a suitable software licence. If you need guidance in choosing a licence for your software, get in touch with the RDM Support Desk.\n\n\nMIT License\nThe MIT License is a popular choice, due to its readability and permissiveness. It allows users to reuse the software for any purpose, including using, copying, modifying, and distributing it, provided they include the original copyright notice and licence text.\nHowever, its permissiveness means that derivative works can be closed-source and do not need to mention that they use your code, which might not align with all scientific openness goals or general.\n\n\nGNU GPLv3\nThe GNU General Public License (GPLv3) is another option, designed to ensure that the software and any derivatives remain open-source.\nThis encourages collaborative improvement of software. Any software that includes GPL-licensed code must also be open-source under the GPLpotentially deterring commercial use or integration with proprietary software. In conclusion, when you want your code to be used by others, but only the code that uses your code is also open source, this is the way to go.\n\n\nApache License 2.0\nThe Apache License 2.0 allows for modification and distribution of the software and its derivative works, with the requirement that changes to the original code are documented.\nIt is a more complex licence than the MIT License and can be incompatible with GPL-licensed software. The specifics of this go beyond the scope of the handbook.\n\n\nAdding a licence to GitHub\nOn GitHub you add a licence on creating a new repository, by selecting the licence from the drop-down menu. If your repository already exists, add a new file called “LICENSE” using the “+”-button on top of the repository (see below).\n\n\n\nLocation of file creation button\n\n\nOne the next page, start to type LICENSE as the file name, and a button to “Choose a license template” should automatically pop up. Follow the steps provided by GitHub to finish adding the licence to the repository.\nYou should now see your licence shown on the main page of your repository.\n\n\nFurther considerations\n\nIf you are reusing software or libraries written by someone else, you must stick to the clauses of the licence given to the original software/library;\nWhen choosing a licence, do not just think about what others may do with the software, but also what you might want to do with the software in the future."

    "text": "Re-using Existing Data\nAnything that can be used for analysis can be considered “data(sets)”. Many national and international organisations provide access to large datasets free of charge: this is called Open Data.\nDatasets may contain different kinds of data files, e.g. raw or edited/cleaned data, and macro or micro data. Raw data refers to the data as they are primarily collected, and includes all data, even the missed or mismatched pieces in the data file. Edited or cleaned data refers to data that have been tidied up for analysis and publication. Macro data and statistics are results based on micro data units and provide a general overview of the micro data. Although datasets can contain data of varying type or aggregation level, and there may be overlap between these definitions, each element can contain very important information.\nWhen re-using research data, scientists must be familiar with the rules and regulations governing data copyright, intellectual property rights, and laws governing sensitive or personal information. SURF has compiled a report on the legal status of raw data including information on the types of consent required for the re-use of data. Your 🔒 Privacy Champion can answer questions about the use of personal data. IXA can provide legal help with the re-use of data.\nSee also the ZonMw explanation of different kinds of property rights in the Netherlands (text available in Dutch only).\n\n\nSources for Finding Existing Datasets\nThe number of datasets that are available grows rapidly. Datasets are made available in many formats, by many people or organizations. Some datasets are raw files and some are specifically organised and formatted as databases that require a licence or subscription to use them. The library of VU Amsterdam has collected links to some of the data repositories used and has licensed several databases.\n\nPopular Free and Licensed Databases: These can be found with LibSearch Advanced.\n\nIf you need help finding & using free or licensed sources you can contact the Research Data Services Helpdesk. For students and personnel in the fields of economics, finance, or organisation science a separate LibGuide has been created to help them find and use/re-use data.\nYou can also start looking for data in these four places:\n\nThe literature. Research articles may point you to the data that they are based on. Sometimes, (part of) the data are added to the article as supplementary files, and sometimes the data are published separately in a data repository. In the latter case, the article usually provides a clear reference to the published dataset. Some datasets may even be specifically published in Data Journals.\nScientific data repositories. Data repositories are platforms used to access and archive research data. Universities often provide a repository for data archiving, but other platforms arranged by discipline or by country also exist. Some repositories are only accessible to consortium members, whereas others are free of charge. Many universities in the Netherlands use DataverseNL to archive datasets for the mid-term. Long-term archiving is provided by the national research data archives DANS and 4TU.Research Data. In Europe, B2SHARE and Zenodo are platforms used to access research data. Data repositories can be accessed by searching by topic or country using Re3data, a data repository registry. VU Amsterdam has its own research portal, PURE, where researchers register their datasets. You can find instructions on how to register your own dataset in PURE on the Dataset Registration page of this LibGuide.\nData search engines. Search engines allow you to quickly browse data sets and supplementary data files published by researchers. They cover data sets from many sources. This makes them useful for quick orientation on a topic. Example of a search engines are: DataCite, Google DataSet Search.\nData portals of (governmental) organisations. Organisations that regularly collect (statistical) data sometimes offer these data through their own portal. An example is Eurostat, which collects and disseminates statistics at the European level, by country and by theme. Some of these websites have been linked in the Finding data LibGuide.\n\n\n\nData Sources for VU Researchers\nResearchers from VU Amsterdam have also developed some databases containing data collected during research. See here for some examples:\n\nNederlands Tweelingenregister (Netherlands Twin Register) The database contains data on twins and their families and was created to do research on the relationship between genetics and growth, development, personality, behaviour, diseases, mental health and all kinds of risks.\nGeoplaza VU - the portal for all matters related to GIS (Geographical Information Systems) and geodata at VU Amsterdam. It offers students and employers a platform to exchange, examine and download digital map material.\nDutch monasteries - database with information about Dutch monasteries of the Middle Ages.\nSlave owners in Amsterdam 1863 - the place of living of owners of slaves in Amsterdam in 1863, visualized in GeoPlaza.\nDeaths at the Borders Database - collection of official, state-produced evidence on people who died while attempting to reach southern EU countries from the Balkans, the Middle East, and North & West Africa, and whose bodies were found in or brought to Europe.\nDatasets published by VU Researchers can be found at the VU Research Portal.\n\n\n\nCitation Elements\nCiting data is not different from citing a journal publication. Similar to citing a journal publication, it helps to give and receive credit, and show the impact of the original source.\nMake sure to check the rules of the journal to know how you should cite when writing an article for a specific academic journal. For all of the journals, however, the minimum compulsory elements in a data citation include:\n\nAuthor(s): Name of the author (creator) of the dataset\nTitle: Name of the dataset\nDate of publication\nPublisher: Archive where dataset is stored\nPersistent Identifier: Unique identifier, most common is the DOI (see section Persistent Identifier).\n\nOptional elements that may be included in the reference are:\n\nFile Type: Codebook, movie, software\nVersion: Version number of the edition\nCreation Date\nDate of Consultation (last)\n\nIf you (re)used another, openly accessible dataset to create your own, it is also important to (first check that the original dataset’s licence permits this and to) cite that dataset correctly. If you want to make clear in a journal article that another dataset was reused, you can add this information, including a citation to the original dataset, to the data availability statement, besides the reference list. In your own dataset, you can use the README file to cite the original dataset and explain how it was reused. You should also add documentation about what processing you did to the original dataset to create your own, and refer to this documentation in the README file. Many repositories prescribe a standard way to cite datasets for several citation styles, and one can very often simply copy and paste that. For example, Zenodo has a citation box on the bottom right of the page, and there one can choose a citation style and simply copy that or export the citation to a citation file (which is useful if you are using EndNote or Zotero). The same can be done in Datacite (example).\n\nExample data citation\nStephens, William, 2020, “Resiliences to Radicalisation - QSort Data”, https://doi.org/10.34894/35MTMN, DataverseNL, V1.\n\nFor more information, see the following guidelines:\n\nDataverse\nDataCite\nDCC UK\nData Citation Synthesis Group (2014).

    "title": "How can you ensure data protection and security during collection, storage, and transfer?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Data collection may consist of the re-use of existing data and/or the generation of new data.\nFor data to be considered valid and reliable, data collection should occur consistently and systematically throughout the course of the research project. Within disciplines, there are established methodologies, procedures and techniques that help researchers ensure high quality of collected data. In general, important aspects of data collection include:\n\nStandardisation: codebooks & protocols\nStructure / organisation of the data\nData quality assurance methods\nDocumentation & metadata\nStorage & protection\n\nSystematic data collection is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of research. When data is collected in a consistent and organized manner, it improves the quality and reliability of the research, making the data easier to share and reproduce by others. High-quality data also contributes to making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), as well-organized and well-documented data is more likely to be reused effectively. The principles of making data FAIR are discussed in detail under the topic FAIR Principles.\n\nData Collection Tools\nThe tools being used in research to collect data are immensely diverse. For that reason, we will not provide an exhaustive overview here. What is important for data collection tools in relation to RDM is where such tools store the data that you collect and in which format. The storage location is particularly important when you are working with personal data. For example, the privacy legislation in the United States is very different from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Hence, personal data collected in a Dutch research institute may not be stored on American servers. It is important to keep that in mind when you are contemplating which tool to use for your data collection.\nIf you are collecting personal data and you decide to use a tool for which no contract exists between VU Amsterdam and the provider of the software or tool, a service agreement and a processing agreement must be drawn up. Contact the 🔒 privacy champion of your faculty for more information and a model processing agreement.\n\nQuestionnaire tools\nThe Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences has developed a document with tips for safe use of the questionnaire tools Qualtrics and Survalyzer. The document was made for FGB researchers specifically but can also be helpful for others. Consult this document if you need a questionnaire tool to collect your data.\n\n\n\nData Collection in Collaboration\nSome research projects involve the participation of multiple organisations or institutes and may include even cross-border co-operation. When data is collected by several organisations, a Data Management Plan should provide information on who is responsible for which part of the data collection and storage. It should also provide information on how specific data collections are related to which part(s) of the research goal(s). Describing this precisely will help you to determine if a consortium agreement or joint controller agreement is necessary. You see a general example of such a specification in the table below:\nData Stage | Dataset description | Responsible organization for collection | Data origin | Data purpose |\n|————|————————————-|————————————————————–|————————————- —————————————————————————| | Raw data | Community level surveys | VU Amsterdam | Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam | Identifying perceived problems, System responsiveness | | Raw data | Trials & Focus Group Interviews | London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) | Germany, Switzerland | Trials to evaluate programs on . . ., Focus Group interviews to identify barriers to . . . | | Raw data | Pollution measurements using fish | Oceanographic Institute of Sweden | Coastal waters, Northeast Spain | Establish pollution levels of plastic |\n\n\nData Collection Protocols\nRegardless of the field of study or preference for defining data (quantitative, qualitative), accurate data collection is essential to maintaining the integrity (structure) of research. Both the selection of appropriate data collection instruments (existing, modified, or newly developed) and clearly delineated instructions for their correct use reduce the likelihood of errors.\nThere are two approaches for reducing and/or detecting errors in data which can help to preserve the integrity of your data and ensure scientific validity. These are:\n\nQuality assurance - activities that take place before data collection begins\nQuality control - activities that take place during and after data collection\n\nQuality assurance precedes data collection and its main focus is ‘prevention’ (i.e., forestalling problems with data collection). Prevention is the most cost-effective activity to ensure the integrity of data collection. This proactive measure is best demonstrated by the standardization of protocol developed in a comprehensive and detailed procedures manual for data collection.\nWhile quality control activities (detection/monitoring and action) occur during and after data collection, the details should be carefully documented in the procedures manual. A clearly defined communication structure is a necessary pre-condition for monitoring and tracking down errors. Quality control also identifies the required responses, or ‘actions’ necessary to correct faulty data collection practices and also minimise future occurrences.\nSome sources for protocols:\n\nHANDS Handbook for Adequate Natural Data Stewardship by the Federation of Dutch University Medical Centers (UMCs)\nProtocols.io - an open access repository of protocols\nSpringer Protocols - free and subscribed protocols collected by Springer.\n\n\n\nStorage During Research\nVU Amsterdam offers several options to store your research data. The choice for a specific option may depend on factors such as:\n\nDoes a project involve multiple organisations or departments?\nThe sensitivity of the data: does it involve personal data or copyrighted / commercial data?\nAre there any research partners with whom data need to be shared?\nAre any commercial parties involved?\nDoes the research project involve multiple locations (inside or maybe even outside the EU)?\nWill there be (lab) devices producing data that need to be stored as well?\nWhat will be the volume of the data?\nWill there be lots of interactions with the data (using software/tools)?\n\nStorage options may take several forms, for example:\n\nLocal storage on computers, networks or servers;\nCloud storage offered by VU Amsterdam;\nLocations where physical data samples are stored (fridges, lockers, etc.).\n\nResearchers, including PhD candidates, have multiple options that can be used, some of which are listed below. More information about these storage options is available behind their respective links. The Storage finder is a tool that will give you a number of storage options suitable for your research. For more individual guidance, please get in touch with the Research Data Management Support Desk for advice, particularly when you are working with commercial, personal or otherwise sensitive data, or when you have a complex IT setup.\n\n\nStandard services offered by VU Amsterdam\nVU IT offers several services for employees to store their files. Examples are:\n\n🔒 OneDrive: personal storage for all VU employees and part of the Microsoft 365 platform. OneDrive allows you to store files locally and in the Microsoft cloud, and share folders and documents with colleagues. Since this is personal storage, tied to someone’s personal VU account, we don’t usually recommend storing research data in OneDrive: if the account holder leaves VU Amsterdam, the account and all the data on it, disappear.\n🔒 Teams. Faculties, divisions and departments have their own Team - part of the Microsoft 365 platform - where they store shared documents and where they can interact and chat. Projects may also request a project team. But note that Teams is not always the best location to store your research data and has several limitations, especially when it comes to working with non-Microsoft file formats, large volumes of data, interacting with data, and collaborating with partners outside of VU Amsterdam. Contact the RDM Support Desk to find out more about the suitability of Teams for your project.\n\n\n\nResearch data-specific storage options\nThe options above are standard data storage options at VU Amsterdam to which all employees have access. But VU Amsterdam also offers storage specifically for research data. Some of them are hosted locally at VU Amsterdam, while others are SURF cloud services. When selecting a cloud-based service it is important to remember to check where the data will be hosted. If the research project involves sensitive data it may be necessary to choose cloud-based options that guarantee that the data will stay in the EEA or on servers based in the EEA.\n\n🔒 SciStor (short for ‘Storage for Scientists’): This is storage hosted by IT for Research (ITvO) and allows for inexpensive storage of large volumes of data. There are various levels of security possible and various ways to get access to the files. SciStor is only intended for ongoing research, not for archiving.\nYoda (short for Your Data) is a cloud storage at SURF and is suitable for storing large-scale and sensitive datasets. Yoda also supports collaborating on projects in and outside VU Amsterdam and adding contextual information (metadata) about your dataset as you go. Yoda is usually the best choice if your research data are very sensitive.\n🔒 Research Drive is a cloud storage at SURF for research projects and is suitable for collaboration in and outside VU Amsterdam, for storing sensitive data and large-scale research projects. You are able to request storage space in Research Drive via a 🔒 web form in the selfservice portal (VU employees only). Research Drive is the best choice if you need to manage access rights on a folder level. SURF has general information about Research Drive, and you can find tutorials on the wiki pages.\n\nThere are differences between Research Drive and Yoda and each one may support certain projects better than others. The storage finder can help you to get an idea of what would be the best choice for your project, but get in touch with the RDM Support Desk for more details. Costs for each of these storage options are detailed on the VU website, including details on how the costs are calculated and billed.\n\n\nSending research data to partners\nSome projects may require data sharing with partners. Although Research Drive and Yoda support sharing data all through the project, it may also be the case that some data only need to be sent to a partner once. There are some secure options to send data to research partners:\n\n🔒 Surf Filesender: cloud service that allows you to send files of 1 Terabyte to other researchers and encrypted files of up to 250 GB.\n🔒 Zivver: All employees of VU Amsterdam can use Zivver, the encryption programme that allows you to send email or data (sensitive or otherwise) securely by email. Attachments will also be encrypted and can be several Terabytes in size (max = 5 TB). Specific information on how to get and use Zivver are available on the selfservice portal. General explanations on how to use it are available at the Zivver website.\n\n\n\nWhat is Data Protection?\nProtection from what? From whom? When, and why? Before we talk about data protection, let us consider security first. More often than not, ‘security’ is regarded as a fixed state. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures.\nThe question for you as a researcher is ‘when are the measures that you take secure enough?’. In order to answer this, please be aware that there are three entities that have an opinion about what is ‘secure enough’, namely: the law, the University, and you yourself as the data processor.\nThe University has a Security Baseline that sets a norm for levels of protection for every application it uses. The Baseline is based on international standards. For each of these applications, the University is considering for which means the security of these applications are adequate enough.\nThe legal requirements for the processing of personal data can be found in the section ‘GDPR and Privacy’ under Plan & Design There are additional laws and regulations as well. The assumption is that you are familiar with these, especially with laws regulating medical and criminal research.\nWhat you personally consider to be secure might be very different from what your colleagues, the Faculty or the University considers to be secure enough and the norms will vary with the variety of data that is being processed by different researchers and Faculties of VU Amsterdam. Very generally speaking, there are three points of protection to consider:\n\nProtection against data loss, for which you need a back up periodically.\nProtection against data leakage, for which you need to consider all storage places and their access points.\nProtection of data integrity, for which you need version control and synchronisation management.\n\nThe security of your protection measures depends on the threat you face. We often think of threats as active, and motivated by bad intentions. But most common forms of data loss are accidental and most leakage is caused by trusting others. In reality, devices just get lost or break down, people download malware by accident, and each one of us forgets to save a document at times or gets confused about which version was last updated.\nIn all cases, protection starts with oversight on where your data is stored and processed. If you forget that you temporarily stored it in a certain place, you have then lost oversight of where that data is. The opposite is also true: if you know where you data is, you have insight in the level of security of the space in which you store it. As you can see, protection begins with organising your work in a reliable manner and thinking through your steps.\nFor example, if you data is on your laptop and synchronised with your phone, then it is stored in two places. Perhaps this is enough back up, perhaps not. If you put both you devices in the same bag and you lose your bag, you have no backup. A backup to an online storage might be a good solution, but might also mean your data leaks via the internet of via the storage provider who sells the data and your behavioural data for profit. Most importantly, there is no absolute security. It is best if you consider your personal behaviour and then think of scenarios that are more or less likely to happen and what would impact you most. If you frequently work in public places you should make it a habit to lock your device each time you leave it. If you eat and drink behind your desk often, better work with a remote keyboard to protect your laptop from the unavoidable coffee shower. Do you save your respondents’ contact details on your personal phone? Then protect it with a pin.\nHere are some basic protection guidelines:\n\nData are very difficult to erase. You have probably never done it.\nDecide how to back up data and test it before you rely on it.\nDo not give others your log-in credentials. If you have done so and your family members use your work device, then change it.\nDo not use passwords twice, do not use your birthday, initials, streetname, hobby.\nEncryption sounds secure, but it fails completely without good password management.\n\n\n\nData Protection\nThere can be many reasons why the data of a project needs to be kept protected:\n\nSensitivity of the data collected\nProtection of the research data from competition\nCommercial reasons / Intellectual property\nEtc.\n\n\n\n\nAn image of a lock composed of code in a matrix green style.\n\n\nThere are also many levels of security that may be implemented, depending on the needs. Sometimes it will be enough to use a password-protected cloud-based server. In extreme cases encryption may be needed and also when data is transmitted between researchers or organisations. You should contact the RDM Support Desk to discuss available options, who may connect you to legal experts where sensitive data is concerned. Check the Data Storage topic for links to find out more on campus solutions and cloud-based options.\n\nSee also the Safe Data Transfer topic for more information on how to transport and transfer data.\n\nIt is important to protect your data during the entire data life cycle. To find out whether your data are secure during all stages of your research, think about your data flow: where do your data originate and where do they go to? If data need to be transported from one physical place to the other, or need to be transferred from one device to another, these actions should happen in a secure way.\n\n\nTransferring digital data\n\nOnline connection on campus\nIf data collection takes place through a certain measurement device (e.g. MRI scanner, EEG scanner, eye tracker), the data need to be transferred from the measurement device to the storage location that you will use during your research project. Make sure that this transfer takes place in a secure way and also make a plan for the data on the measurement device; find out whether they need to be destroyed or can remain there.\n\n\nOnline connection outside campus (with and without VUnetID)\nIf you are doing fieldwork outside the campus and you have reliable and secure internet access, it is a good idea to upload the data to a storage location that is regularly backed up and secure, in order to prevent data loss. If you have a VUnetID, you can for example use:\n\nResearch Drive to securely and easily store and share research data.\nSURFfilesender to send you data to a colleague or consortium partner, who can store your data in an appropriate place\n\nYou can find more information about each of these storage options in the Data Storage topic.\nIf you need to receive data from colleagues in your project who don’t have access to these tools (e.g. because they are students, don’t work for a Dutch educational institution, or have no VUnetID), Research Drive, Yoda, SURFfilesender and secure emailing with Zivver can also be used:\n\nResearch Drive: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location.\nSURFfilesender: as a SURFfilesender user, you can send a voucher to someone who doesn’t have access to this tool. This person can use this voucher to send documents to you. These files can be encrypted.\nYoda: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location.\n🔒 Zivver is an email plugin with which you can encrypt emails and attachments.\n\n\n\nOffline data outside campus\nIf you are doing fieldwork in an area with limited internet access, you might use a portable device to initially store your data during the phase of data collection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive. These data can be transferred to a storage location that is connected to the internet (e.g. Research Drive, Yoda) later. Please make sure that the data on such portable devices are secured, by using encryption (and by transporting them safely by using a lockable briefcase or backpack).\n\n\nTransporting physical data\nIf physical objects need to be transported, you should check with the data manager at your department (if available) what options are available. Special briefcases that can be locked or secure backpacks may need to be used to keep informed consent forms or other sensitive data objects (USB drives etc.) secure during transport. A checklist may help to ensure all objects will be taken along.\n\n\nData transportation and transfer across borders\nSome countries have rules to control the movement of encryption technology that enter or exit their borders. If you need to travel with an encrypted laptop to secure your data, for example during fieldwork abroad, please keep this in mind. If you need to transfer data in and out of such countries, please get advice on encryption and secure transportation at the IT Service Desk.\n\n\nSupport\nIf you have general questions about how to protect your data when transporting or transferring them, you can contact the IT Service Desk. In case of complex situations for which you need tailored support, you can consult the IT Relationship Manager representing the research domain, who can request capacity at IT for setting up an information security plan. Such a plan is usually based on documents which need to be completed beforehand, like a Data Protection Impact Assessment and a Data Classification."

    "text": "Data processing\n\nData cleaning\nThe process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate information or records, is called data cleaning. In essence, it refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting this data (Wikipedia). Depending on the type of analysis that is done, different pieces of software can be used to do this data cleaning. More often than not, the same software can also be used to perform the analysis. Licensed software may sometimes also be installed on personal computers or laptops.\n\nSoftware especially designed to clean re-used data is OpenRefine. It cleans starting and trailing blank spaces in cell field, clusters values based on similarities (e.g. in free text fields: Alphen a/d Rhijn, alfen ad rijn, etc. can be easily clustered), normalise data fields into one standard, etc. See below for several tutorials.\nIn some cases, researchers write their own scripts (in programming languages such as Python, R or SQL) to clean data, in which case the process must be documented. Researchers should include their scripts when they archive the datasets to allow for replication and verification.\nExtra background information:\n\nEMGO Quality Handbook on data cleaning\nMaking sense of data I: a practical guide to exploratory data analysis and data mining / Glenn J. Myatt, Wayne P. Johnson, 2014 (eBook)\nOpen Refine\n\nData Carpentry Open Refine website\nTutorial by the Programming Historian\nIntroduction to Digital Humanities with Open Refine\n\n\nFor every step of your data cleaning, good documentation and clarifying the data provenance is necessary.\n\n\nData transcription\nIt is common in many fields to hold interviews, focus group sessions, or make other observations that were recorded - video or audio. If indeed you have done so, and you need to have the text transcribed, there are several ways to do this. One option is to do this by hand, although this is very time-consuming.\nAnother option is to pay a transcription service to make the transcription or to use specialised software. VU Amsterdam has drawn up processing agreements with one transcription service, Transcript Online, and one transcription software service, Amberscript.\nYou can find more information on the VU Library page on what these transcription options do, how they work, how much they cost, and how they can be used.\n\n\nAnonymisation/Pseudonymisation\nProcessing of personal data requires you as a researcher to make sure that any personal data collected from a human subject is according to the EU GDPR regulation. Anonymisation and Pseudonymisation are two ways to make personal data less easy to identify, in other words, it allows you to de-identify personal data.\nThere are various online tools that may help facilitate these processes. VU Amsterdam has therefore recommended Amnesia as one of the tools to assist in the anonymisation/pseudonymisation of data.\nVU Amsterdam is preparing a decision guide on anonymisation and pseudonymisation."

    "section": "Data analysis",
    "text": "Data analysis\n\nData Analysis\nAlthough data analysis is an ongoing process throughout the research project, this page focuses on the analysis of the data subsequent to its collection. To ensure that research is empirical and verifiable, it is crucial that researchers keep records (data documentation) of every step made during the data analysis.\nData analysis converts raw/processed data into information that is useful for understanding. Many steps may be required to gain useful information from raw data. The process of processing and analysing data may require computing power not readily available or specific storage and protection options. If multiple parties are involved in the analysis, data sharing may also be necessary.\nData analysis often requires the use of specialised software. VU Amsterdam offers licences for several data analysis software packages. For analysing qualitative data, and specifically text, VU has a licence for Atlas.TI. For analysing quantitative data, VU offers licences for SPSS, Matlab and Stata. For open software, see below.\nIn some cases researchers write their own scripts to analyse the data. At VU Amsterdam, most scripts are written in R and Python.\nIf you want to read up on data analysis you should check out what journal articles and books VU Amsterdam library has available on the subject:\n\nAll sources: Data analysis\nQuantitative data analysis\nQualitative data analysis\nBig data\nData mining\n\n\n\nOpen Software\nUsing open software increases the Accessiblity, Interoperability and Reusability of your data. For that reason, we recommend that you use open software as much as possible for your data analysis. This could be software, code or scripts that you have written yourself - where possible, please make this software public, so your analysis is reproducible. Examples of open software are R and Python, which can be used instead of proprietary, commercial software such as SPSS and Matlab.\nResearchers often write their software themselves. There are also organisations that specialise in writing research software, such as the eScience Center. The eScience Center offers the software they built for free use online. Their software is tagged with a DOI and stored in Zenodo as well as GitHub.\nIf you use software for analysing personal or otherwise sensitive data, you need a processing agreement with the developer if the software does not run locally. You can contact your 🔒 Privacy Champion if you are not sure if you need one, and for help to set up a processing agreement.\nThere are several ways in which to start using open software:\n\nFor Python: you should install Anaconda and launch the Jupyter Notebook from the Navigator.\nFor R: you should install Anaconda and launch R Studio from the Navigator.\nUse the Software Carpentries to learn the basics of programming in Python and R and version control with Git\nRead the recommendations for FAIR Software.\n\nVU Amsterdam has several research groups that offer their code online. You can find them here:\n\nThe Systems Bioinformatics research group, on GitHub\nThe Computational Lexicology & Terminology Lab, on GitHub\nThe course Python for Text Analysis, on GitHub\nVU RDM Tech IT group, on GitHub\nA list of RDM tools, on GitHub\n\n\n\nCompute services\n\nIf your pc or laptop takes too much time performing your analysis, it is time to scale up to a higher level. There are several options for employees and students who require more computing power than their own desktop or laptop can provide.\nSeveral options are detailed below. 🔒 Contact IT for Research for advice on which solution could best fit your workflow\n\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC)\n\n\n\nA set of servers in an undescript room\n\n\nRoughly speaking, you should try to get access to the HPC when you need to stick a post-it on your laptop or PC that says: “do not touch, analysis ongoing”. Or when you want to run analyses parallel to each other, because they take too long. It is important to consider such a situation at the very beginning of your research or when writing your Data Management Plan: is it conceivable that your dataset will become so large or your analysis so complicated that you will need HPC? Please note that this can occur for any discipline and any sort of data, qualitative and quantitative. If you may need HPC, you also need to reconsider your analysis methods. Programmes like SPSS and Excel do not run well on a HPC, and you would need to (learn to) write scripts in R or Python. If you want to know if using HPC may be necessary or useful for your project, you can contact IT for Research to ask for more information (select the “Onderzoek service domain”).\n\n\nSURF Snellius Compute Cluster\nSnellius is the Dutch National supercomputer hosted at SURF. The system facilitates scientific research carried out in many Universities, independent research institutes, governmental organizations, and private companies in the Netherlands.\nIt’s a service comprising a wide range of resources, compilers and, such as R statistics and MATLAB, and libraries. SURF continually adjusts the service to the needs of the user community. For example, Snellius Compute Cluster includes accelerators (very fast processors),high memory nodes and GPU nodes. \nYou can find more information on the SURF Snellius Wiki.\n\n\nADA Compute Cluster\nIT for Research (ITvO) offers access to your own Linux computational cluster at VU Amsterdam. ADA is a managed service for high performance computing (HPC). Research groups can add their own compute server hardware to ADA, ITvO will take care of configuring and maintaining the software stack on your servers.\nADA also has several “community” nodes for use by all VU researchers, sponsored by VU Amsterdam HPC Council.\nADA is connected to SciStor  providing easy access to your research data and analysis result.\n\n\nVU JupyterHub for education\nIf you are not yet ready to take the leap to cluster computing and work with Python consider JupyterHub. VU IT has built a Jupyter Notebook environment meant mainly for Education purposes, but accessible for researchers as well on https://hub.compute.vu.nl/\n\n\n(Virtual) servers\nThere are also several options to run applications in a server environment. This is useful if for example you use software that does not work on HPC, you want to run a web service, you want to create a research environment for your project. There are several options available for researchers.\n\nSciCloud\nIT for Research (ITvO) offers a virtual server environment where you can run your own server (Linux or Windows). ITvO installs the basic operating system and you are free to install needed software. Web services can be made accessible on the internet. You can find more information and a request form on the 🔒 VU service portal\n\n\nSURF Research Cloud\nSURF also offers a virtual server environment. Several environments with pre-installed software can easily be installed from a catalog. Find more information on the SURF wiki.\n\n\nDedicated hardware\nSometimes your workload needs dedicated hardware. ITvO offers the option to host your own server hardware in our on-campus data center. Please 🔒 Contact IT for Research to discuss possibilities."

    "text": "This page offers a short explanation of essential concepts in High Performance Computing.\n\nConcurrent vs. Parallel\nConcurrent programs handle multiple instruction sequences at the same time.\nParallel programs execute multiple instruction sequences at the same time.\nWhen a program runs in parallel on multiple cores it is always concurrent.\nWhen a program is handled concurrently, it is not necessarily a parallel program. Instructions can also make use of time-sharing (e.g. sharing a single CPU core).\n\n\nMultithreading vs. Multiprocessing\nMultithreaded programs use multiple threads and are all part of the same process. These threads share the same memory and resources.\nMultiprocessed programs use multiple processes. Each process has its own memory and resource allocation.\nBoth multithreaded and multiprocessed programs are concurrent programs, they are therefore also not necessarily parallel.\nMultiprocessed programs however enable true parallelism, by using multiple CPU cores simultanously where each CPU core is assigned one process.\n\n\nCompute Time vs. Communication Overhead\nIn HPC, program execution often focuses on designing multiprocessing programs that execute tasks in parallel across multiple compute nodes. A crucial consideration is balancing compute time against communication overhead.\nFor instance, when dealing with large datasets, distributing the workload by dividing the data into smaller chunks across multiple processors can significantly reduce computation time. However, excessively fine-grained data partitioning can lead to substantial communication overhead, where the time spent transferring data between nodes outweighs the computational gains.\n\n\nAmdahls Law\nAmdahls law is formula that shows how much faster a task can be completed when more resources are added to a system. In the context of P (fraction of the code that can be parallelized) and N (number of processors) the speedup is defined as follows:\n\nSpeedup = 1 / (1 - P + P / N)\n\nBelow example illustrates that the serial portion of a program has a big impact on the overall speedup:\n\n\n\nAmdahls Law\n\n\nWhen using ADA, take Amdahls Law into consideration: parallelize your code as much as possible before scaling up your requested processors.\n\n\nTerms\nCPU: a physical, central processing unit in compute hardware. Most modern day CPU’s are multi-core, containing multiple cores.\nvCPU: a virtual, central processing unit. A CPU can contain multiple vCPU’s.\nCore: a physical processing unit on a CPU chip.\nLogical core: a virtual processing unit. A core can have multiple logical cores.\nHyperthreading: a technology that allows a core to appear as two logical cores in an operating system. Most hardware in the ADA cluster uses this technology by default. Compute intensive workloads will benefit to disable hyperthreading.\nGPU: a physical, graphical processing unit in compute hardware.\nvGPU: a virtual, graphical processing unit. A GPU can contain multiple vGPU’s.\nRAM: Random Access Memory, the temporary storage for data that the CPU needs. RAM offers fast Read/Write speeds and is volatile (data is lost when power is turned off).\nHDD: Hard Disk Drive, persistent storage offering Read/Write operations.\nSSD: Solid State Drive, persistent storage that offers faster Read/Write speeds than HDD’s.\nScratch Space: When we refer to scratch space, we usually refer to the local SSD storage on the compute nodes. Use of scratch can significantly speed up your programs if it relies heavily on data operations.",

This is your persistent storage area for configuration files, datasets, etc. This folder is shared across all ADA nodes.\nLogin nodes are for lightweight tasks only—editing scripts, managing files, preparing SLURM submissions. Do not run VS Code Server, Jupyter, container builds, or heavy computations here. Use interactive nodes or Open OnDemand for those workloads.\n\nNo notebooks, VS Code Server, heavy compiles, or long-running jobs on login nodes.\n\nSee the software overview for managing applications and environments.\n\n\nSubmit a Batch Job\nTo actually run your computations, you need to submit jobs to the SLURM scheduler. For SLURM jobs, you need to specify resources (memory, CPU, walltime), partition and additional devices (GPUs) you require. SLURM will then allocate resources and run your job on appropriate compute nodes once they are free. Please see the SLURM essentials page for ADA-specific options and best practices.\nHere we will create and submit a simple SLURM script from the login node:\ncat &gt; hello.sbatch &lt;&lt;'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=hello\n#SBATCH --time=00:02:00\n#SBATCH --partition=defq\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1\n\nmodule load 2025\nmodule load Python/3.12.3-GCCcore-13.3.0\npython - &lt;&lt;'PYCODE'\nprint(\"Hello from ADA!\")\nPYCODE\nEOF\n\nsbatch hello.sbatch\nwhere we requested a single CPU and requested to run on the general use defq partition. If you have access to department specific partitions, please use those instead as defq resources are pitifully limited.\nYou can monitor progress with squeue -u &lt;VUNETID&gt; and inspect the output in slurm-&lt;jobid&gt;.out. More SLURM patterns and best practices are in SLURM essentials.\n\n\nTrack and Inspect Jobs\n\nLive queue view:\nsqueue -u &lt;VUNETID&gt;\nFinished job summary:\nsacct -j &lt;jobid&gt; --format=JobID,State,Elapsed,MaxRSS,CPUTime\nStream output while a job runs:\ntail -f slurm-&lt;jobid&gt;.out\n\n\n\nMove Data\nThere are times when you will need to transfer data from your local machine/some server onto ADA. For that, you can use the the same SSH proxy configuration for secure copy scp.\nFor example, copying a results.txt onto the ADA cluster is:\nscp results.txt ada-login:~/project/\nAnd likewise copying files from the cluster onto your local machine is:\nscp ada-login:~/project/output.dat .\nPrefer rsync for larger transfers or frequent syncs.",

People with a “group manager” role can add members to a research Group, remove them, and change their roles.\nSee: Managing groups, users and access rights\n\n\nResearch (active data)\nThe main folder (“research-…”) contains current research data that researchers collaborate on. Data is kept in subfolders. The subfolders can be organized according to the needs of the research Group.\nYou can also drag-and-drop files to your research folder or download individual files.\nYou can Add metadata to a folder at any time to describe the dataset contained in that folder and its subfolders.\nWhen you know a (subset of) your data must be archived for the long term, the data in a subfolder can be submitted to the Yoda Vault so that it is kept for 10 years or longer.\n\n\nVault (archived data)\nThe folder named “vault-…” contains these deposited data packages. Data in the Vault cannot be deleted and the research Group has read access.\nResearchers can opt to (but do not have to) publish any of the vault deposited data packages to make the metadata of a data package known to the research community at large.\nYoda adds a DOI persistent identifier to published data so that the data package can be cited and found in catalogs such as Datacite, Narcis, B2Find etcetera.\nIf (and only if) the data has been classified as “open” then the content itself can be downloaded by anyone from the internet.

    "text": "Making data FAIR – how to get started in three easy steps?\n\nStart with a data management plan\nA DMP is a living document in which you specify what kinds of data you will use in your project, and how you will process, store and archive them. Preparing a data management plan should be your first step in the process to make data FAIR. The DMP template will ask questions that enable you to systematically address the things that need to be done to make your data FAIR. Writing a DMP is also a requirement from funding agencies and some faculties at VU Amsterdam. At VU Amsterdam, you can use DMPonline to create and share DMPs.\n\n\nDescribe and document your data\nTo be findable, data need to be described with appropriate metadata. Metadata can include keywords, references to related papers, the researchers’ ORCID identifiers, and the codes for the grants that supported the research. You will need to provide such metadata when you are uploading data to a repository (see below). You increase findability by filling out as many metadata fields as possible and by providing rich descriptions in terminology that is common in your field.\nTo be reusable, data need to be accompanied by documentation describing how the data was created, structured, processed, and so on. It is good practice to integrate writing documentation during the research process. It will be easier and take less time compared to when you try to do this at the end. Having documentation on the research process will also help you to redo parts of your data cleaning actions or data analysis if necessary.\nIf you have questions about metadata and documentation, contact the RDM Support Desk and we will be happy to help you and to provide advice.\n\n\nMake your data available through a trustworthy repository\nIf you choose a repository that: assigns a persistent identifier to both the data and the metadata; attaches metadata to the data according to standard metadata schemas; releases data with a license; and provides access to the data and metadata via an open and standard communication protocol (such as http) – then your data will meet many, if not most, of the FAIR principles.\nVU Amsterdam provides three repositories which meets all of these conditions:\n\nDataverseNL\nYoda\nOpen Science Framework (OSF)\n\nCosts for using these repositories for datasets up to 500 GB are covered by the faculty. There are costs involved for you department or project if a datasets is larger than 500 GB. See the storage cost model for details."

The guiding principle is always that data should be as “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. If data cannot be openly shared, because they are too sensitive, then “the FAIR approach would be to make the metadata publicly available and provide information about the conditions for accessing the data itself.”"

    "text": "Transferring digital data\n\nOnline connection on campus\nIf data collection takes place through a certain measurement device (e.g. MRI scanner, EEG scanner, eye tracker), the data need to be transferred from the measurement device to the storage location that you will use during your research project. Make sure that this transfer takes place in a secure way and also make a plan for the data on the measurement device; find out whether they need to be destroyed or can remain there.\n\n\nOnline connection outside campus (with and without VUnetID)\nIf you are doing fieldwork outside the campus and you have reliable and secure internet access, it is a good idea to upload the data to a storage location that is regularly backed up and secure, in order to prevent data loss. If you have a VUnetID, you can for example use:\n\nResearch Drive to securely and easily store and share research data.\nSURFfilesender to send you data to a colleague or consortium partner, who can store your data in an appropriate place\n\nYou can find more information about each of these storage options in the Data Storage topic.\nIf you need to receive data from colleagues in your project who don’t have access to these tools (e.g. because they are students, don’t work for a Dutch educational institution, or have no VUnetID), Research Drive, Yoda, SURFfilesender and secure emailing with Zivver can also be used:\n\nResearch Drive: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location.\nSURFfilesender: as a SURFfilesender user, you can send a voucher to someone who doesn’t have access to this tool. This person can use this voucher to send documents to you. These files can be encrypted.\nYoda: This cloud storage service provided by SURF enables researchers from VU and external researchers to manage files and folders in a shared storage location.\n🔒 Zivver is an email plugin with which you can encrypt emails and attachments.\n\n\n\nOffline data outside campus\nIf you are doing fieldwork in an area with limited internet access, you might use a portable device to initially store your data during the phase of data collection, such as a USB drive or an external hard drive. These data can be transferred to a storage location that is connected to the internet (e.g. Research Drive, Yoda) later. Please make sure that the data on such portable devices are secured, by using encryption (and by transporting them safely by using a lockable briefcase or backpack).\n\n\nTransporting physical data\nIf physical objects need to be transported, you should check with the data manager at your department (if available) what options are available. Special briefcases that can be locked or secure backpacks may need to be used to keep informed consent forms or other sensitive data objects (USB drives etc.) secure during transport. A checklist may help to ensure all objects will be taken along.\n\n\nData transportation and transfer across borders\nSome countries have rules to control the movement of encryption technology that enter or exit their borders. If you need to travel with an encrypted laptop to secure your data, for example during fieldwork abroad, please keep this in mind. If you need to transfer data in and out of such countries, please get advice on encryption and secure transportation at the IT Service Desk.\n\n\nSupport\nIf you have general questions about how to protect your data when transporting or transferring them, you can contact the IT Service Desk. In case of complex situations for which you need tailored support, you can consult the IT Relationship Manager representing the research domain, who can request capacity at IT for setting up an information security plan. Such a plan is usually based on documents which need to be completed beforehand, like a Data Protection Impact Assessment and a Data Classification."

Each category has an “i” which provides for more explanation on each condition.\nThe first category (Confidentiality) is relevant to privacy or other data that needs to be kept confidential. The other two categories relate to the impacts of data losses (Availability) and inappropriate alterations or corruption (Integrity). Once all relevant boxes under each category have been checked, a tile will be highlighted. This tile contains further details about the data-related risks and describes the steps that should be taken.\nYou can save the results of the risk assessment by pressing the “Export” button. This will produce a PDF, including the links. The result you get is not a formal data classification, although it will be sufficient for many projects with low and medium risks.\nThe information from the assessment can be used for DMPs, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) or full (formal) classification. You can also use it to find a suitable storage location for your data through the Data Storage Finder. One of the filters in the Data Storage Finder is called ‘Data classification’, which refers to the level of ‘Confidentiality’ from a data classification.\nNote that because the risks may vary for different types of data, you should repeat this process for each type of data you will use in your research. For example, a research project with multiple datasets, will require numerous risk assessments."

The National Supercomputer provides that with a large number of super-fast processors. The system is ideally suited for large-scale experiments, such as simulations and modelling. These require a lot of processing power and memory usage, but also communication between the different processors. An important feature of Snellius is its fast internal network.\n\n\nComputing power\nSnellius runs on Linux. Besides AMD processors, the system also features GPGPUs (General Purpose Graphics Processing Units). These accelerators combine the processing power of graphics cards (GPUs) with that of CPUs. In addition, Snellius has ‘fat nodes’ with more memory space (1 TB) and ‘high-memory nodes’ (4 TB and 8 TB of memory space).\n\n\nTools and libraries\nAs a researcher, you can make use of a large collection of tools, compilers and libraries.\nAre you doing research or experiments in the field of machine learning, e.g. neural networks? The libraries and tools on Snellius make it a lot easier."

Direct institute contract\nThe VU has a contract with SURF for the usage of Snellius. Every VU researcher or master student can request Snellius SBUs (System Billing Units). The total amount available to the VU is limited however, only use this option for smaller projects, say up to 1.000.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs.\nThe SURF wiki provides some guidance on estimating the amount of SBUs you need. We recommend you start with the default 50.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs. You can use the same form to request a top-up if you run out.\n\n\n2. NWO compute grant\nIf you have a large project involving more than 1.000.000 CPU and/or GPU SBUs you should apply for an NWO Large Compute applications grant.\nEach Snellius account is provided with 200GB Home space (backups available), apart from that 8TB of temporary fast scratch space is available for your calculations. If the Home space is not sufficient or you can request Project Space to store your data during your project. Note that the Project Space is not backed-up! Always make sure a copy of valuable data is also stored on a recommended storage system.\nNote that for large-scale GPU projects access the European LUMI supercomputer can also be requested by VU researcers.

    "text": "What can it be used for?\nThe particular strength of Yoda lies in the fact that it is an all-in-one solution for managing your data during and after your project. It makes it easy to share and organise your data and add descriptive metadata at any moment. If (part of) your datasets needs to be published during or after your project, this can be done by a few simple steps within Yoda itself. There is no need to upload your data to another platform.\n\nData storage\nYoda is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to very large datasets. The underlying iRODS software ensures data integrity. Data in Yoda is backed up daily.\n\n\nData sharing\nOnce a new Yoda group has been created you can invite collaborators yourself. Researchers from national and international research institutes can login with their institutional account via SURF Research Access Management (SRAM). Collaborators from non-research institutes can create a free EduID NL account.\n\n\nSensitive data\nThe use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with SRAM and hosting at SURF ensure, among other things, Yoda is suitable for the storage and sharing of data that score High on confidentiality in a data classification (see the Policy Classification of Research Data and the Research Data Classification Tool). Please make sure to contact the RDM Support Desk to check if further measures are needed.\n\n\nMetadata\nAt any moment you can add descriptive metadata to a folder in Yoda via a web form. This means you can easily organize your data in such a way that it is not only ready for archiving and publishing but also findable for your collaborators.\n\n\nArchiving\nAt any moment you can submit a data folder with metadata for Archiving in the Yoda Vault. Data in the Vault is read-only and cannot be deleted. To help make sure the dataset is suitable for archiving a Yoda datamanager (usually a data manager from your department or a faculty data steward) will review your submission before final approval. Data in the Vault is directly accessible for your collaborators. Access for the Yoda datamanager role ensures the data remains accessible on the long term.\n\n\nPublishing metadata and data\nFrom the Yoda Vault you can submit the dataset for publication. A DOI will be generated and registered with DataCite together with the metadata. DataCite ensures your dataset becomes findable on the internet and citable.\nThe DOI link will lead to a landing page in Yoda showing the metadata. The dataset itself can be Open, allowing direct download, Restricted, meaning other researchers need to follow a data request procedure, or Closed, signalling the dataset is properly archived but not available for reuse.\n\n\nAutomated workflows\nSince Yoda is build on iRODS you could also build (automated) ingest and analysis workflows using iRODS Rules and Policies.

In the latter case, the article usually provides a clear reference to the published dataset. Some datasets may even be specifically published in Data Journals.\nScientific data repositories. Data repositories are platforms used to access and archive research data. Universities often provide a repository for data archiving, but other platforms arranged by discipline or by country also exist. Some repositories are only accessible to consortium members, whereas others are free of charge. Many universities in the Netherlands use DataverseNL to archive datasets for the mid-term. Long-term archiving is provided by the national research data archives DANS and 4TU.Research Data. In Europe, B2SHARE and Zenodo are platforms used to access research data. Data repositories can be accessed by searching by topic or country using Re3data, a data repository registry. VU Amsterdam has its own research portal, PURE, where researchers register their datasets. You can find instructions on how to register your own dataset in PURE on the Dataset Registration page of this LibGuide.\nData search engines. Search engines allow you to quickly browse data sets and supplementary data files published by researchers. They cover data sets from many sources. This makes them useful for quick orientation on a topic. Example of a search engines are: DataCite, Google DataSet Search.\nData portals of (governmental) organisations. Organisations that regularly collect (statistical) data sometimes offer these data through their own portal. An example is Eurostat, which collects and disseminates statistics at the European level, by country and by theme. Some of these websites have been linked in the Finding data LibGuide."

This is specified in the following ways:\n\nInclusive development and innovation: Data should support Indigenous innovation and generate value for Indigenous communities. Use and reuse of data by Indigenous Peoples should be enabled and stimulated by governments and research institutions.\nCommunity value creation: Data ecosystems should be designed to support Indigenous communities’ self-determination and collective benefit, and to foster transparency, engagement and understanding between Indigenous Peoples and their (local) governments and policymakers.\nEquitable outcomes: Data use should promote equitable outcomes for Indigenous peoples and communities and contribute to Indigenous aspirations for wellbeing.\n\n\n\nAuthority to Control\nIndigenous Peoples’ must have the right and authority to control their data and how they and information about them are represented in data. This is specified further as follows:\n\nRights recognition: Indigenous Peoples have inherent rights and interests relating to Indigenous data and to individual and collective Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC).\nData for governance: Indigenous Peoples have the right to (access to) data that empower their world-view, self-determination and self-governance.\nGovernance of data: Indigenous Peoples have the right to determine what happens to their data.\n\n\n\nResponsibility\nThose working with Indigenous data are responsible for showing that the data use supports and benefits Indigenous Peoples. They also have to be transparent about how the data are used. This is specified as follows:\n\nPositive relationships: Researchers and data users should build respectful, trusted and reciprocal relationships with Indigenous Communities.\nFor expanding capability and capacity: Those working with the data should support Indigenous Peoples’ capacity to work with data capability to develop infrastructure for data.\nFor Indigenous languages and worldviews: Those working with the data should provide resources that enable generating and collecting data in Indigenous languages and cultural contexts.\n\n\n\nEthics\nIndigenous People’s rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern for data users during the entire data lifecycle. This is specified in the following points:\n\nMinimising harm and maximising benefit: Data use should minimise harm and risks to Indigenous communities and should be collected and used according to Indigenous Peoples’ frameworks. Benefits should be assessed based on Indigenous Peoples’ perspectives.\nJustice: Data practices should promote justice and representation for Indigenous Peoples\nFuture use: Data governance must include considerations for future use and prevent potential future misuse of data according to the Indigenous People’s frameworks."

    "title": "CARE Principles",
    "section": "Implementation of the CARE principles",
    "text": "Implementation of the CARE principles\nLike the FAIR principles, the CARE principles must be implemented consciously and conscientiously, and specific effort must be made to support them in research-performing institutions. That said, it is important to emphasise that the purpose of the CARE principles is fundamentally different from the FAIR principles. The FAIR principles aim to promote transparency and maximum data reuse potential, which can create an image of data as a neutral, independent entity. Under the CARE principles, data collected by/with/about Indigenous Peoples are understood as fundamentally tied to these Indigenous Peoples and the CARE principles underscore their ownership, authority and rights to the data. While data reuse can occur and/or be beneficial for Indigenous Peoples data, it is not always the best outcome or the primary aim.\nIn the context of the Netherlands research-performing institutions could consider the following to support researchers with implementing the CARE principles:\n\nMaking researchers aware of the CARE principles and helping them to find resources for their application in their field.\nSupporting international working groups and alliances that develop the CARE principles further, such as the Global Indigenous Data Alliance and the Research Data Alliance (RDA’s) International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group.\nMaking Indigenous data FAIR, bearing in mind the considerations outlined above.\nApplying the CARE principles to their own collections and services.\n\n\nIndigenous data in university (library) collections\nUniversities and other research-performing institutions may already be holding data concerning Indigenous Peoples, whether they be research data or archives or objects in a university library’s (special) collections. This means that universities and university libraries have responsibilities with regards to the CARE principles.\nWhere research data are concerned, it is mostly important to ensure that free, prior and informed consent was given for the data to be collected and/or published, and that the data were also initially shared with the Indigenous People from which they originated. At VU Amsterdam, data stewards already have experience with similar processes around (regular) personal data. If you find that you are working with, or your department holds datasets to which the CARE principles apply, and you have questions about how they should be handled, your first point of contact may be the RDM Support Desk or your faculty’s data steward.\nLibrary (special) collections may also require some care, especially if researchers would like to use them. At the 2025 LIBER Conference in Lausanne (Switzerland) a roundtable comprising of librarians who specialise in Indigenous Knowledges and/or had an Indigenous background discussed the ways libraries can incorporate Indigenous Knowledges and collections in their services while taking the CARE principles into account. The roundtable highlighted the fact that Indigenous Peoples may historically not have been included in libraries’ collection development and collection access, and that due to a historical legacy of colonialism and racism, existing library catalogues may contain terms and descriptions that are inaccurate, offensive and harmful. The roundtable further raised that library staff need to be more aware of these issues in managing their collections. To actively engage with some of these concerns, the VU University Library started a working group to revisit descriptions of works in the library catalogue through the lens of decolonisation. In this way, the working group tries to contribute to a more inclusive library environment for diverse users."

These are important goals for VU Amsterdam, as they contribute to a transparent reseach practice and enable other researchers to build on work that has been done by VU researchers. Publishing data means that researchers make their datasets known to the world, even if they cannot be accessed by others directly, but only after granting conditional access. This enables other researchers reusing these data, leading to more impact of research that is carried out at VU Amsterdam. It may also result in new collaborations. Another advantage is that it makes the work of a researcher more visible, going beyond the visibility of a publication alone."

    "text": "Requirements\nAt VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research data FAIR. Publishing data is a crucial step in making data findable. As explained in the definition above, publishing means that you make data discoverable on the internet. As a result, other researchers can find out about the existence of your dataset and consider whether it may be useful for them in their own research.\nA persistent identifier helps in making data findable, because it ensures that the persistent identifier always resolves to the correct digital object. Rich metadata also contribute to the findability of a dataset. The more information you provide, the more likely it is that others will be able to find your dataset. It is beneficial to use terminology that is common in your discipline when filling out the metadata fields in a repository. Rich information about your dataset will also help other researchers determine whether your dataset is potentially relevant for them.\nRepositories provided by VU Amsterdam (Yoda and DataverseNL) will generate a Persistent Identifier for your dataset and they will ask you to fill out metadata fields. In this way, they contribute to making your data findable. This will also be the case for external trusted repositories.\nWhen you publish your data, it is important to apply a licence to it. If you don’t do that, others will not be allowed to reuse your data. A licence is a legal instrument that tells others what they can and cannot do with your data and is therefore an important aspect of making data reusable."

    "text": "The importance of knowledge security regarding research data\nAt VU Amsterdam, we attach great value to international collaboration, which is crucial for top-level research and high-quality academic education. As well as opportunities – for research, education, innovation and open knowledge sharing – it also entails risks. Universities are being targeted for acquiring sensitive knowledge and technologies. A possible consequence of this is the undermining of academic freedom and censorship (including self-censorship).\nThe Framework addresses potential ethical issues, such as the risk of violating human rights or academic values, the misuse of knowledge, the safety of researchers and respondents (for instance if the research might cause them to be pressured or coerced), unintended knowledge transfer, and harm to people, animals or the environment. This means that it is important to consider the possible consequences for yourself, your colleagues and the research subjects if your research data falls into the wrong hands, e.g. data on a minority group or a key technology (especially technology that falls under dual use1 regulation) that a repressive government can misuse. If you work with sensitive research data*, want to openly publish your data and/or your collaborative partner is an organisation or affiliated to an organisation from a country that has a score of 0.4 or less on the Academic Freedom Index, the collaboration should be discussed with the faculty’s contact person.\nAlso, measures can be taken in consultation with the contact person (see Support within your faculty) and data steward to mitigate the risks. Possible measures include limiting access to sensitive research data (physically and digitally, e.g. encryption), data anonymisation or pseudonymisation, an adequate data classification, a Data Protection Impact Assessement (DPIA), limiting or excluding collaboration with certain partners and other appropriate protection measures.\n* Sensitive research data regarding knowledge security includes: \n\nResearch data that falls under the dual use regulation1;\nResearch data on key technologies or other technologies that are considered by the Dutch government to be militarily, economically and geopolitically strategic;\nResearch data on ethically sensitive topics (see question 5 of the Framework);\nResearch data related to minority or repressed research subjects."

Since this is personal storage, tied to someone’s personal VU account, we don’t usually recommend storing research data in OneDrive: if the account holder leaves VU Amsterdam, the account and all the data on it, disappear.\n🔒 Teams. Faculties, divisions and departments have their own Team - part of the Microsoft 365 platform - where they store shared documents and where they can interact and chat. Projects may also request a project team. But note that Teams is not always the best location to store your research data and has several limitations, especially when it comes to working with non-Microsoft file formats, large volumes of data, interacting with data, and collaborating with partners outside of VU Amsterdam.

There are various levels of security possible and various ways to get access to the files. SciStor is only intended for ongoing research, not for archiving.\nYoda (short for Your Data) is a cloud storage at SURF and is suitable for storing large-scale and sensitive datasets. Yoda also supports collaborating on projects in and outside VU Amsterdam and adding contextual information (metadata) about your dataset as you go. Yoda is usually the best choice if your research data are very sensitive.\n🔒 Research Drive is a cloud storage at SURF for research projects and is suitable for collaboration in and outside VU Amsterdam, for storing sensitive data and large-scale research projects. You are able to request storage space in Research Drive via a 🔒 web form in the selfservice portal (VU employees only). Research Drive is the best choice if you need to manage access rights on a folder level.

See also the definition of ‘processing’ according the official text of the GDPR.\nDirect and indirect identification: Some identifiers enable you to identify an indiviual directly, such as name, day of birth and home address. Individuals can also be identifed indirectly. For example via:\n\na combination of information that uniquely singles out an individual (e.g. a male with breast cancer in a breast cancer registry, a pregnant individual over 50 etc.), this includes information in one record and information across different data files or datasets\nunique information or patterns that are specific to an individual (e.g. genomic data, a very specific occupation, such as the president of a large company, repeated physical measurements or movement patterns that create a unique profile of an individual or measurements that are extreme and could be linked to subjects such as high-level athletes)\ndata that are linked to directly identifying information through a random identification code or number\n\nPseudonymous data: Data that are indirectly identifiable are generally considered to be pseudonymous; this means that they are NOT anonymous and still qualify as personal data. Therefore, the GDPR applies to these data. This is for example the case when direct identifiers are removed from the research data and put into a key file (or what is usually called a subject identification log in medical research) with which the direct identifiers can be mapped to the research data through unique codes, so that reidentification is possible. These data are therefore considered to be pseudonymous data for the research institution and not anonymised data. LCRDM (National Coordination Point Research Data Management) has made a reference card that illustrates the difference between pseudonymous and anonymous data."

    "text": "There is a difference between storing and archiving data. Storing refers to putting the data in a safe location while the research is ongoing. Because you are still working on the data, the data still change from time to time: they are cleaned, and analysed, and this analysis generates output. As the image below illustrates, storing could be like cooking a dish: you are cleaning and combining ingredients.\nArchiving, on the other hand, refers to putting the data in a safe place after the research is finished. The data are in a fixed state, they don’t change anymore. Archiving is done for verification purposes: so others can check that your research is sound. Or: it is done so that others can reuse the resulting dataset. There is also a difference between archiving and publishing, but in essence, archiving and publishing happen at a similar moment and for both, data do not change anymore.\nThis illustration is created by Scriberia with The Turing Way community.

    "section": "Selecting Data for Archiving",
    "text": "Selecting Data for Archiving\nThere are various reasons to archive your data: replication, longitudinal research, data being unique or expensive to collect, re-usability and acceleration of research inside or outside your own discipline. It is VU policy to archive your data for (at least) 10 years after the last publication based on the dataset. Part of preparing your dataset for archiving is appraising and selecting your data.\n\nMake a selection before archiving your data\nDuring your research you may accumulate a lot of data, some of which will be eligible for archiving. It is impossible to preserve all data infinitely. Archiving all digital data leads to high costs for storage itself and for maintaining and managing this ever-growing volume of data and their metadata; it may also lead to decline in discoverability (see the website of the Digital Curation Centre). For those reasons, it is crucial that you make a selection.\n\n\nRemove redundant and sensitive data\nSelecting data means making choices about what to keep for the long term, and what data to archive securely and what data to publish openly. This means that you have to decide whether your dataset contains data that need to be removed or separated. Reasons to exclude data from publishing include (but are not limited to):\n\ndata are redundant\ndata concern temporary byproducts which are irrelevant for future use\ndata contain material that is sensitive, for example personal data in the sense of the GDPR, like consent forms, voice recordings, DNA data; state secrets; data that are sensitive to competition in a commercial sense. These data need to be separated from other data and archived securely\npreserving data for the long term is in breach of contractual arrangements with your consortium partners or other parties involved\n\nIn preparing your dataset for archiving, the first step is to determine which parts of your data are sensitive, which can then be separated from the other data. Redundant data can be removed altogether.\n\n\nDifferent forms of datasets for different purposes\nOnce you have separated the sensitive data from the rest of your dataset, you have to think about what to do with these sensitive materials. In some cases they may be destroyed, but you may also opt for archiving multiple datasets. For example, you may want to archive your dataset in more than one form depending on the purpose. For example:\n\nOne for reusability to share\nA second one that contains the sensitive data, and needs to be handled differently.\n\nFor the first, the non-sensitive data can be stored in an archive under restricted or open access conditions, so that you can share it and link it to publications. For the second, you need to make a separate selection, so the sensitive part can be stored safely in a secure archive (a so-called offline or dark archive). In the metadata of both archives you can create stable links between the two datasets using persistent identifiers.\n\n\nWhat to appraise for archiving\nThere are several factors that determine what data to select for archiving. For example, whether data are unique, expensive to reproduce, or if your funder requires that you make your data publicly available. This might also help you or your department to think about a standard policy or procedures for what needs to be kept, what is vital for reproducing research or reuse in future research projects.\nMore information on selecting data:\n\nTjalsma, H. & Rombouts, J. (2011). Selection of research data: Guidelines for appraising and selecting research data. Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS).\nDigital Curation Centre (DCC): Whyte, A. & Wilson, A. (2010).

    "text": "What can it be used for?\n\nData storage\nResearch Drive is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small (a few GBs) to larger (a few TBs) datasets. Because it is a cloud storage platform you will need to download data to your laptop to work with it. Research Drive makes this easy by using the Nextcloud client, which allows you to automatically sync the folders you want to work with. Data is backed up daily.\n\n\nData sharing\nAs project owner you can invite internal and external collaborators yourself, or you can delegate this task to others.\nYou can set access rights to folders and subfolders yourself, making Research Drive ideal for use in collaborations with many institutions.\n\n\nSensitive data\nHosting at SURF and the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), among other measures, makes Research Drive suitable for storing data that score Medium on confidentiality (see the Policy Classification of Research Data and the Research Data Classification Tool). Data that score High on confidentiality can be stored in Research Drive with additional security measures. Please make sure to contact the RDM Support Desk to check if further measures are needed.\n\n\nData life cycle\nResearch Drive is meant for data you are actively working with. We recommend to archive datasets that are no longer actively used, but can’t be deleted, in a repository. Transferring data from Research Drive to a repository ensures Research Drive is used optimally and costs are kept down for your research group and VU Amsterdam. Repositories that are available at VU Amsterdam are Yoda and DataverseNL. Yoda is suitable for all types of data, including personal data and other types of confidential data. DataverseNL is only suitable for data that can be made available publicly.\n\n\nCollaborative tools\nWithin Research Drive, various apps and integrations are available to simplify the use and handling of research data, such as a tool to edit documents directly in the web interface. You can find a current list of app integrations on the SURF User Knowledge Base.\n\n\nSURFdrive replacement\nSince both are based on Nextcloud, Research Drive is very similar to SURFdrive, the main difference is that SURFdrive is personal storage while Research Drive is group based.\nResearchers looking for a new home for research data currently on SURFdrive are encouraged to migrate to Research Drive. Manuals for migrating data to Research Drive are available in English and Dutch. Please contact the Research Support Desk if you have any questions about migrating to Research Drive."

For example, if you’re sending out surveys for your research, the survey responses are considered a data asset. If, in addition to the surveys, you’re also holding focus groups, the data collected from the focus group are also considered a data asset, separate from the survey results. Most projects will have more than one data asset per data stage. It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analysed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organisation. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make them more understandable and suitable for analysis.

    "text": "Persistent Identifiers for data and software in repositories\nPersistent Identifiers can be assigned to datasets and software upon their deposit in a repository. In many repositories, this is a DOI. Data repositories are entitled to generate Persistent Identifiers for data and software. This is one of the reasons why archiving and publishing data and software has to be done in a repository. After the process of uploading data or software to a repository, a Persistent Identifier will be generated. Upon publishing the data or software, the DOI is registered online (usually at DataCite when it concerns a dataset).\nSome repositories enable their users to reserve a Persistent Identifier before the publishing process has finished, so that you can include the Persistent Identifier in a publication before the data will be actually published, or to include the Persistent Identifier in a readme file. This is for example possible in Zenodo.\nThe repositories offered by VU Amsterdam, Yoda and DataverseNL provide DOIs for deposited datasets and software."

A SciStor share can be directly mounted on the server to increase storage for your application or directly access your source data for analysis.\n\n\nADA\nThe ADA HPC cluster is connected to SciStor via a high speed netwodrk. You can run your analysis software directly on your data and easily access the results on your laptop.\n\n\nSharing data\nBecause SciStor is mainly intended for high performance, on-campus use, access is only possible with a VUnetId. If you need to share data with non-VU researchers you could register them as an external employee or host a copy of the data on another storage platform like Research Drive or Yoda\n\n\nData life-cycle\nSciStor is meant for data you are actively working with. We recommend archiving datasets that are no langer actively used, but can’t be deleted, in Yoda. This ensures SciStor is used optimally and costs are kept down for your research group and the VU."

Controlled vocabularies are intended to reduce ambiguity that is inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and to ensure consistency. Controlled vocabularies are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri, taxonomies and other knowledge organisation systems. Some vocabularies are very internationally accepted and standardised and may even become an ISO standard or a regional standard/classification. Controlled vocabularies can be broad in scope or very limited to a specific field. When a Data Management Plan template includes a question on the used ontology (if any), what is usually meant is: is there a specific vocabulary or classification system used? The National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden gives some more explanation about controlled vocabularies and ontologies. In short, an ontology does not only describe terms, but also indicates relationships between these terms.\nExamples of controlled vocabularies are:\n\nCDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art)\nGetty Thesaurus of Geographic names\nNUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics)\nMedical Subject HEadings (MeSH)\nThe Environment Ontology (EnvO)\n\nMany examples of vocabularies and classification systems can be found at the FAIRsharing.org website.

This could be related to questions researchers have, for example about data storage, publishing, or the use of RDM tools. The RDM Support Desk also supports researchers with writing a Data Management Plan and other RDM-related tasks. There is a second line of RDM application managers (see for example Yoda and Research Drive) who can onboard users and help them with the use of RDM tools. It can also be helpful to contact the RDM Support Desk when you are writing a grant application, and you have to write the data management section.\nThe Support Desk strives to send you a reply within 2 working days. Depending on the complexity of your question, this reply could also be an explanation of how the question will be tackled, or could ask clarifying questions to understand the issue better."

    "section": "What can it be used for?",
    "text": "What can it be used for?\nDataverseNL is a simple method to archive and publish datasets. Through the platform it becomes very easy to share data and documents from your research. The platforms generates a webpage displaying your data and accompanying metadata, and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which enables increased visibility and quick references to your dataset. It is possible to make files within your dataset only accessible on request. Please note that DataverseNL is only suitable for archiving and publishing datasets that do not contain personal data or other types of confidential data. Even though access to data files in DataverseNL can be restricted, datasets containing personal data or other types of confidential data must not be uploaded to DataverseNL. A suitable repository for archiving and publishing personal and sensitive data is Yoda.\n\nData storage\nDataverseNL is a Cloud storage solution that can be used for small to large datasets. The datasets are preserved through backup copies of the data.\n\n\nData sharing\nThrough the generated DOI you can make your dataset easy to find and access. You can reference it in your publications and through your profile page on the VU Research Portal (PURE).\n\n\nSensitive data\nAlthough DataverseNL is meant for Open Access datasets, it is possible to restrict access to particular files. This means it is possible to archive medium sensitive (anonymised) data. As explained above, personal data or other types of confidential data that score High or Very High on confidentiality (see the Policy Classification of Research Data and the Research Data Classification Tool) must not be uploaded to DataverseNL. Data that score High or Very High on confidentiality can be archived and published in Yoda.\n\n\nMetadata\nYou can add descriptive metadata to a dataset draft in DataverseNL. After publication of the dataset it is still possible to alter the metadata, but this will result in a new version of the dataset. If you feel metadata fields are missing, a request can be sent to SURF to add these fields. The requirement for this change is that the added metadata fields are part of an internationally recognised dataset metadata scheme."

These are important goals for VU Amsterdam, as they contribute to a transparent reseach practice and enable other researchers to build on work that has been done by VU researchers. Publishing software means that researchers make their software known to the world, even if they cannot be accessed by others directly, but only after granting conditional access. This enables other researchers to reuse the software, leading to more impact of research that is carried out at VU Amsterdam. It may also result in new collaborations and citations. Another advantage is that it makes the work of a researcher more visible, going beyond the visibility of a publication alone.\nPublication of research is not complete without the data used and the code written to clean and analyse it. Publishing data and software allows other researchers to use and build upon your work."

    "section": "Requirements",
    "text": "Requirements\nAt VU Amsterdam, we strive to make our research software FAIR. Publishing software is a crucial step in making it findable. As explained in the definition above, publishing means that you make software discoverable on the internet. As a result, other researchers can find out about the existence of your code and consider whether it may be useful for them in their own research.\nA persistent identifier helps in making software findable, because it ensures that the persistent identifier always resolves to the correct digital object. Rich metadata also contribute to the findability of software. The more information you provide, the more likely it is that others will be able to find your software. It is beneficial to use terminology that is common in your discipline when filling out the metadata fields in a repository as well as key words in a key words or notes section of the metadata. Rich information about your software will also help other researchers determine whether your software is potentially relevant for them and is faster to assess than reading through the code itself.\nRepositories provided by VU Amsterdam (Yoda and DataverseNL) will generate a Persistent Identifier for your software and they will ask you to fill out metadata fields. In this way, they contribute to making your software findable. This will also be the case for external trusted repositories (such as Zenodo).\nWhen you publish your software, it is important to apply a licence to it. If you don’t do that, others will not be allowed to reuse your software. A licence is a legal instrument that tells others what they can and cannot do with your software and is therefore an important aspect of making software reusable.\nSince code can be written in any number of ways to solve a problem, the absolute minimum that should be published to ensure verification is a (working) copy of the code/workflow that uses the raw data to produce the end result you have presented in your research and a list of the dependencies and their versions."

You can assign a DOI at project level, but currently it is not possible in OSF to create an immutable copy of a file with its own DOI. For that reason, OSF is not the most suitable option for publishing software. If you do prefer to make your research output visible through OSF, you can consider having an additional copy of your code in the Yoda vault or connecting published software in DataverseNL to your OSF project, so that it can be viewed in OSF.\nDetailed workflows addressing publishing software can be found in the guide about making your software FAIR and the topic about archiving software."

Archiving your software ensures that software will be preserved for the long term and can be accessed, even when the Principal Investigator or other members of the research team are no longer available at VU Amsterdam.\nProper software archiving transforms research software from temporary project tools into lasting scientific contributions that continue to generate value long after the original project concludes, supporting both individual career development and broader scientific progress."

Without a license the software cannot be used in future research as easily;\nThe software must be accompanied by documentation, both user and developer. User documentation should cover installation and basic use, whereas developer documentation should cover how it works and why certain design decisions were made.\n\nIf you use an external repository, these requirements are useful to keep in mind as well, because they make the software FAIR to a large extent, but in that case you will have to rely on the properties of the repository.\nSince code can be written in any number of ways to solve a problem, the absolute minimum that should be archived to ensure verification is a (working) copy of the code (or workflow) that takes the raw data to the end result and a list of the dependencies and their versions."

This means that data storage solutions for during research, like Research Drive, are not suitable for software archiving. They don’t generate a Persistent Identifier and do not ask for metadata or a licence. Code repositories like GitHub and GitLab fall under the label of development environments: They have the possibility to include a DOI and metadata, but do not require it. As a result, VU Amsterdam recommends using the following services for archiving research software:\n\nZenodo: Long-term preservation with permanent DOIs, integrated with GitHub for automatic archiving\nDataverseNL: For software associated with published datasets and research outputs\nYoda: For data and software associated with research; note that this is not by default publicly accessible.\n\nA more complete form of software archiving involves capturing not just the source code, but also the complete software environment, dependencies, documentation, and metadata necessary to understand, execute, and maintain the software over time. This includes preserving information about the runtime environment, operating system requirements, library dependencies, and usage instructions. As a result, unlike regular backup or version control, software archiving specifically focuses on long-term preservation to combat software decay and technological obsolescence."

What is important for data collection tools in relation to RDM is where such tools store the data that you collect and in which format. The storage location is particularly important when you are working with personal data. For example, the privacy legislation in the United States is very different from the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Hence, personal data collected in a Dutch research institute may not be stored on American servers. It is important to keep that in mind when you are contemplating which tool to use for your data collection.\nIf you are collecting personal data and you decide to use a tool for which no contract exists between VU Amsterdam and the provider of the software or tool, a service agreement and a processing agreement must be drawn up. Contact the 🔒 privacy champion of your faculty for more information and a model processing agreement.\n\nQuestionnaire tools\nThe Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences has developed a document with tips for safe use of the questionnaire tools Qualtrics and Survalyzer.

Both the selection of appropriate data collection instruments (existing, modified, or newly developed) and clearly delineated instructions for their correct use reduce the likelihood of errors.\nThere are two approaches for reducing and/or detecting errors in data which can help to preserve the integrity of your data and ensure scientific validity. These are:\n\nQuality assurance - activities that take place before data collection begins\nQuality control - activities that take place during and after data collection\n\nQuality assurance precedes data collection and its main focus is ‘prevention’ (i.e., forestalling problems with data collection). Prevention is the most cost-effective activity to ensure the integrity of data collection. This proactive measure is best demonstrated by the standardization of protocol developed in a comprehensive and detailed procedures manual for data collection.\nWhile quality control activities (detection/monitoring and action) occur during and after data collection, the details should be carefully documented in the procedures manual. A clearly defined communication structure is a necessary pre-condition for monitoring and tracking down errors. Quality control also identifies the required responses, or ‘actions’ necessary to correct faulty data collection practices and also minimise future occurrences.\nSome sources for protocols:\n\nHANDS Handbook for Adequate Natural Data Stewardship by the Federation of Dutch University Medical Centers (UMCs)\nProtocols.io - an open access repository of protocols\nSpringer Protocols - free and subscribed protocols collected by Springer."

    "text": "Protection from what? From whom? When, and why? Before we talk about data protection, let us consider security first. More often than not, ‘security’ is regarded as a fixed state. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures.\nThe question for you as a researcher is ‘when are the measures that you take secure enough?’. In order to answer this, please be aware that there are three entities that have an opinion about what is ‘secure enough’, namely: the law, the University, and you yourself as the data processor.\nThe University has a Security Baseline that sets a norm for levels of protection for every application it uses. The Baseline is based on international standards. For each of these applications, the University is considering for which means the security of these applications are adequate enough.\nThe legal requirements for the processing of personal data can be found in the section ‘GDPR and Privacy’ under Plan & Design There are additional laws and regulations as well. The assumption is that you are familiar with these, especially with laws regulating medical and criminal research.\nWhat you personally consider to be secure might be very different from what your colleagues, the Faculty or the University considers to be secure enough and the norms will vary with the variety of data that is being processed by different researchers and Faculties of VU Amsterdam. Very generally speaking, there are three points of protection to consider:\n\nProtection against data loss, for which you need a back up periodically.\nProtection against data leakage, for which you need to consider all storage places and their access points.\nProtection of data integrity, for which you need version control and synchronisation management.\n\nThe security of your protection measures depends on the threat you face. We often think of threats as active, and motivated by bad intentions. But most common forms of data loss are accidental and most leakage is caused by trusting others. In reality, devices just get lost or break down, people download malware by accident, and each one of us forgets to save a document at times or gets confused about which version was last updated.\nIn all cases, protection starts with oversight on where your data is stored and processed. If you forget that you temporarily stored it in a certain place, you have then lost oversight of where that data is. The opposite is also true: if you know where you data is, you have insight in the level of security of the space in which you store it. As you can see, protection begins with organising your work in a reliable manner and thinking through your steps.\nFor example, if you data is on your laptop and synchronised with your phone, then it is stored in two places. Perhaps this is enough back up, perhaps not. If you put both you devices in the same bag and you lose your bag, you have no backup.

    "text": "Protection from what? From whom? When, and why? Before we talk about data protection, let us consider security first. More often than not, ‘security’ is regarded as a fixed state. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures.\nThe question for you as a researcher is ‘when are the measures that you take secure enough?’. In order to answer this, please be aware that there are three entities that have an opinion about what is ‘secure enough’, namely: the law, the University, and you yourself as the data processor.\nThe University has a Security Baseline that sets a norm for levels of protection for every application it uses. The Baseline is based on international standards. For each of these applications, the University is considering for which means the security of these applications are adequate enough.\nThe legal requirements for the processing of personal data can be found in the section ‘GDPR and Privacy’ under Plan & Design There are additional laws and regulations as well. The assumption is that you are familiar with these, especially with laws regulating medical and criminal research.\nWhat you personally consider to be secure might be very different from what your colleagues, the Faculty or the University considers to be secure enough and the norms will vary with the variety of data that is being processed by different researchers and Faculties of VU Amsterdam. Very generally speaking, there are three points of protection to consider:\n\nProtection against data loss, for which you need a back up periodically.\nProtection against data leakage, for which you need to consider all storage places and their access points.\nProtection of data integrity, for which you need version control and synchronisation management.\n\nThe security of your protection measures depends on the threat you face. We often think of threats as active, and motivated by bad intentions. But most common forms of data loss are accidental and most leakage is caused by trusting others. In reality, devices just get lost or break down, people download malware by accident, and each one of us forgets to save a document at times or gets confused about which version was last updated.\nIn all cases, protection starts with oversight on where your data is stored and processed. If you forget that you temporarily stored it in a certain place, you have then lost oversight of where that data is. The opposite is also true: if you know where you data is, you have insight in the level of security of the space in which you store it. As you can see, protection begins with organising your work in a reliable manner and thinking through your steps.\nFor example, if you data is on your laptop and synchronised with your phone, then it is stored in two places. Perhaps this is enough back up, perhaps not. If you put both you devices in the same bag and you lose your bag, you have no backup. A backup to an online storage might be a good solution, but might also mean your data leaks via the internet of via the storage provider who sells the data and your behavioural data for profit. Most importantly, there is no absolute security. It is best if you consider your personal behaviour and then think of scenarios that are more or less likely to happen and what would impact you most. If you frequently work in public places you should make it a habit to lock your device each time you leave it. If you eat and drink behind your desk often, better work with a remote keyboard to protect your laptop from the unavoidable coffee shower. Do you save your respondents’ contact details on your personal phone? Then protect it with a pin.\nHere are some basic protection guidelines:\n\nData are very difficult to erase. You have probably never done it.\nDecide how to back up data and test it before you rely on it.\nDo not give others your log-in credentials. If you have done so and your family members use your work device, then change it.\nDo not use passwords twice, do not use your birthday, initials, streetname, hobby.\nEncryption sounds secure, but it fails completely without good password management."

No, this will break the build\nError: “YAML parsing error” - Cause: Invalid YAML syntax in front matter or _quarto.yml - Solution: Check YAML indentation and syntax - Can ignore in PR? No, this will prevent building\nError: “Duplicate anchor” - Cause: Multiple headings with the same text create duplicate IDs - Solution: Make heading text unique or use custom IDs - Can ignore in PR? Yes, but should be fixed for better navigation\n\n\nStyle issues\nInfo: “Missing alt text” - Cause: Images without alt text - Solution: Add descriptive alt text for accessibility - Can ignore in PR? Should be addressed for accessibility, but won’t break the build\n\n\nMarkdownlint errors\nMarkdownlint checks for consistent markdown formatting. This only runs if topics or guides are changed.\nCommon errors include:\nMD001: Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time - Cause: Skipping heading levels (e.g., H1 directly to H3) - Solution: Use proper heading hierarchy - Escape: Add &lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD001 --&gt; before the heading\nMD033: Inline HTML - Cause: Using HTML tags in markdown - Solution: Use markdown syntax instead, or use HTML when necessary - Escape: Add &lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 --&gt; around HTML sections - Can ignore in PR? Usually yes, HTML is sometimes needed for advanced formatting\nMD041: First line in file should be a top level heading - Cause: File doesn’t start with H1 heading - Solution: Add H1 heading or use YAML front matter - Escape: Add &lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 --&gt; at the top - Can ignore in PR? Yes, especially for files with YAML front matter\nThe full set of rules can be found in the markdownlint documentation.\n\n\nHow to disable Markdownlint rules\nYou can disable specific rules in a document in several ways:\nFor a single line:\n&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Some HTML content&lt;/div&gt;\nFor a section:\n&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 --&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;HTML content&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;More HTML&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 --&gt;\nFor an entire file:\n&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD033 --&gt;\nIn a .markdownlint.json config file:\n{\n  \"MD013\": false,\n  \"MD033\": false\n}\nPlease edit the existing .markdownlint.json file in case you want to ignore certain rules project-wide."

You can create one directly on GitHub.\n\n\n\nSuggesting edits\nThe easiest and quickest way to contribute to the book is make suggested edits. On each page you will find a button reading “Edit this page” (usually on the right).\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a handbook topic, with a red box on the right hand side of the page indicating where to find the “Edit this page” button\n\n\nWhen you click that, you will immediately be taken to GitHub to edit the text of that specific page. You may be prompted to create a fork (forking) in case these are your first edits.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the GitHub file editor, with some changes made and the “Commit changes” button active\n\n\nOnce you made your edits, you are ready to commit (save) your changes and submit your pull request, requesting those changes to be included in the handbook.\n\n\nAdding a topic\nTo add a new topic, you need to create a new file ending in .qmd in the topics folder (e.g., topics/example.qmd). You can do this by visiting the handbook page on GitHub and clicking Add file -&gt; New file.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of GitHub highlighting where to find the “New file” button\n\n\nWhen you click this button you may be asked to fork the repository. This is not a problem so go ahead!\nThe topic itself needs to be written in Markdown. Every topic must be a noun/noun phrase and contain the title as such:\n---\ntitle: Example topic\n---\nSection headings are second level headings (e.g., ## Section). You can add all needed information as you want, but please mind that topics are supposed to short and self-contained for readers of the Research Support Handbook.\nAfter that, you are ready to submit your pull request! The reviewers will help you place the topic in the right place of the book.\n\n\nAdding a guide\nTo add a new guide, you need to create a new file ending in .qmd in the guides folder (e.g., guides/example.qmd). You can do this by visiting the handbook page on GitHub and clicking Add file -&gt; New file.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of GitHub highlighting where to find the “New file” button\n\n\nWhen you click this button you may be asked to fork the repository. This is not a problem so go ahead!\nEvery guide title must reflect the question the guide answers. Add the title by adding the following information at the top of your document:\n---\ntitle: How do I create a guide?\n---\nSection headings are second level headings (e.g., ## Section). The guide itself needs to be written in Markdown.\nYou can re-use topics literally in your guides. For each topic you want to include, you can either mention so on a line surrounded by whitespaces:\nINSERT TOPIC: DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN\nThis will tell the editorial team to include that topic there. Please be specific in naming the topic. You can also directly include the topic yourself directly using the following code:\n\n## Topic name\n\n    ```{.include shift-heading-level-by=2}\n    ../topics/replace-with-filename.qmd\n    ```\nYou need to count the heading level in your guide to identify your shift number. In this case, there are two ## so we shift by two. You can verify the filename directly, but it should correspond to each word separated by a minus sign (for example, data-management-plan.qmd).\nAfter that, you are ready to submit your pull request!\n\n\nEditing multiple files\nThere are situations in which you need to edit multiple files. If you carry out all edits in separate pull requests, this may be a long and repetitive task. Instead, you can change multiple files at once in a single pull request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn case you want to edit multiple files in one go, here’s a video to help you along the way!\n\n\nVideo\nVideo describing the steps to use the GitHub editor to edit multiple files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit a pull request\nOnce you have made suggested changes, a pull request is the way for you to ask for your changes to be incorporated into the Research Support Handbook. The handbook editors will review what you wrote, ask some questions, and accept or decline your contributions.\nWe recommend keeping your suggested changes small or limited in scope, and explaining why you are suggesting these changes. It is more likely your changes are included when you are fixing a typo or adding a paragraph, and less likely if you are revising the entire handbook. It is also more likely they are included if you explain why you are suggesting the changes, rather than dropping by and making edits without any context.\nIf you are adding a new topic or guide, it is definitely recommended to open an issue first to see whether there is a need for it (and maybe you’ll find collaborators!).\nDuring the review process you may be asked to update your changes, or revisions may be added by the people maintaining the handbook. It is helpful if you keep an eye on your GitHub account to ensure timely responses to help the process along. By contributing, you become part of the process :blush:. Once you have submitted the contribution, the editors will decide how to add your contribution to the handbook. Take a look at the Editor’s guide to learn more about what criteria they consider.\n\n\nWriting text\nThe book is created using Markdown - you can get familiarized with the basic syntax on the Markdown website. The getting started quick items are:\n# Heading level 1\n## Heading level 2\n### Heading level 3\n\nYou simply write text as you are used to. To make something *italic*, **bold**, or ***bold and italic***.\n\n&gt; this is how you add quotes\n\n- or lists\n- that can go on\n- and on\nIf you want to add code, use references, create links, or footnotes - it is all possible. We will expand examples here based on your needs, so if you need help, let us know by reporting an issue!\n\nAdding relative links\nOften, you will want to link to other pages or sections in the Research Support Handbook. Instead of going to the website, and pasting the link from there (for example, https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/contributing.html), you can add what is called “relative links.”\nRelative links require three concepts:\n\nWorking directory: The folder in which the file you are editing is located\n./ = indicates the current folder\n../ = indicates the folder one level up\n\nThis Contributing guide is located in the “root” directory, and there is no upper folder. If we wanted to link to a topic, we would use ../topics/example-topic.qmd. This would create a relative link to the example file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRelative links link to the .qmd files, never to the .html pages. These only exist when the pages are rendered!\n\n\nIf we were editing a topic, and we wanted to link out to a guide, we would need to use ../guides/example-guide.qmd. This because we would be in the topic folder for that file, and need to navigate one level up (../) and then down into the guides folder. For topic to topic references, we do the same (../topics/example-topic.qmd). This ensures that the links work also when a topic is embedded into a guide directly.\n\nSection links\nWhenever we link to a specific guide or topic, you can also link to a specific section. This helps you point readers to what you want them to read, and helps them find the information they need.\nThe easiest way to find these section links is to navigate to the relevant page, and click on the link icon next to the heading. This will cause your URL to change.\n\n\n\nScreenshot indicating the link icon next to a heading, and the updated URL as a result\n\n\nYou add the #adding-a-guide (as applicable in your case) to the end of your relative link, and you will have created a relative section link! :blush:\nIf the section is on the same, you can drop the relative link altogether and keep only the part after the # (for example, #adding-a-guide).\n\n\n\n\nAdding images\nIn markdown, you can easily add images and alt text at the same time. We require alt text on all images, and if you are contributing an image, you can best describe its value in the text.\nYou add images by using:\n![Alt text](URL)\nIf you want the image to be hosted in the Research Support Handbook, use the following steps:\n\nAdd the image you want to the public/ folder\nMark the exact filename\nUse ../public/&lt;filename&gt; as the URL for the image (for example ../public/image.png)\n\n\n\nMore information about GitHub\nWe use GitHub to create this website automatically, and to manage all the incoming updates. You do not need to know how it works entirely, but we want to help you understand some things so you are not confused.\n\nRepository\nA repository on GitHub is like a folder on your computer. This can be many things, depending on what files it contains.\nWhen we mention a repository here, we mean that we want you to look at a specific folder. The repository for this website for example can be found on GitHub directly. You will always be contributing to a repository, in order to contribute to the handbook.\n\n\nForking\nA repository is owned by one or multiple people on GitHub. If you are not one of them, you can create a copy of the repository (folder) to make your edits in. This act of creating a copy is called “forking.”\nWhen you create a copy, you do not have to worry about accidentally removing or destroying the handbook. Your changes are not reflected in the website until you submit a pull request."

    "text": "Rendering handbook locally\nSometimes you may want to preview the changes you are making to the handbook. That is possible in most cases, but requires you to install some software. You need to install Quarto and assuming a successful installation, you then need to run the following code in your terminal1:\n# Clone the git repository\ngit clone https://github.com/ubvu/open-handbook\n# Go into the right folder\ncd  open-handbook\n# Render the handbook\nquarto render .\nThis will create a file called _site/index.html. You can now open the rendered website in your browser by running:\n# For Windows machines, use\nstart &lt;browser-name&gt; _site/index.html\n# For Mac machines, use\nopen _site/index.html\n# For Linux, it could depend on the exact Linux operating system, but you could try first\nxdg-open _site/index.html\nNote that you should not copy the &lt; and &gt;, they are written here to indicate where the browser name should come.\nYou can also make changes locally and push them to the github repo to open a new branch. The procedure for this in your terminal is as follows:\n# Navigate to the folder where the file you want to edit is located\ncd &lt;foldername&gt;\n# Open the file to edit\nnano &lt;filename&gt;\n# Edit the file and save by using `Control + O`. Exit nano by `Control + X`\n# Add the file to the staging area\ngit add &lt;filename&gt;\n# Commit the edits\ngit commit -m \"&lt;commit message&gt;\"\nOnce you are done editing, you can also render the page to check that all is well. If you have already used quarto render . once, you can simply re-render the page you were working on, using quarto render &lt;path/filename.qmd&gt;, e.g. quarto render ./topics/yoda.qmd, which is a lot quicker. Note that you should not copy the &lt; and &gt;, they are used here to indicate where to add file and folder names, or a suitable commit message.\nOnce you are happy with the result, you can push the new version back to the github repository online:\n# Push the edits to the remote (online) repository. You can only push to a new branch: the main branch is protected.\n# If you do not have editing rights to the handbook repository, you would be pushing to your fork.\ngit push origin main:&lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n# You may have to authenticate using your SSH key.\nNote that you should not copy the &lt; and &gt;, they are written here to indicate where file and folder names should be written. After doing this, your new branch is opened in the repository on GitHub and you can create a pull request.\nThis procedure requires some background knowledge on working (with git) in the command line.

    "text": "Using VS Code to contribute\nIf you are planning to make multiple contributions to the Handbook, working in the GitHub web interface can get cumbersome. In that case we suggest you use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to create and edit pages. An IDE is a text editor that has lots of extra functionalities for developers, such as integration with Git. VS Code is a widely used, free, IDE and it is very well suited to edit Markdown files and has integrated Git & GitHub support. This allows you to work on your edits on your laptop whenever you want, preview them using the Quarto client and Push your changes to GitHub. No special knowledge of the Git Commandline is necessary.\n\nInstall VS Code\nVS Code is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Install it from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.\nNote that VS Code is a Microsoft product, but the source code of VS Code is open source. The VS Code version you download from the above link is not, and it contains telemetry/tracking. A completely open source version without telemetry is available from https://vscodium.com, the functionality is the same.\n\n\nInstall the Quarto extension for VS Code\nInstall the Quarto Extension to make sure VS Code understands the Quarto format.\nNote that unfortunately the Preview functionality does not work very well with a project as large as the Handbook.\n\n\nMake sure Git is installed\n\nOpen VS Code and click on the Git icon on the left. If you do not have Git installed you can do so from here, the download button will lead you to https://git-scm.com/downloads, you do not need the GUI client.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Git\n\n\n - During the install you can set VS Code as default editor\n\n\n\nRecommended PATH option\n\n\n\nKeep defaults for the rest.\nOpen a command prompt to set your username and email address, without this you cannot push your changes to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nSet git username and email\n\n\n\n\nCreate a root folder\nCreate a folder where your handbook copy and other code projects will be stored. For example on Windows C:\\users\\&lt;username&gt;\\VS Code.\nNote that it is not advisable to store code projects in a folder which is synced with OneDrive (such as the “Documents’ folder), OneDrive will have problems syncing the many small files that git uses. The same applies to SURFdrive and Research Drive. You will push changes to your code projects to github so there is no need to make extra backups.\n\n\nCreate a Fork of the Handbook\n\nGo to the Handbook repository on GitHub.\n\n - Click Fork button at the top right.\n - You end up with all the code in your personal account.\n\n\nClone your Fork\n\nGo to the Git Tab (or click File &gt; New window), there you will see the option to “Clone Repository”.\n\n\n\n\nClone Repository\n\n\n - You see the option “Clone from GitHub”.\n\nSign in to GitHub\n\n\n\nAllow GitHub sign in\n\n\n\nIf you have never signed in with Git before you will be asked to do so. Click Allow.\nThe GitHub Sign In page will be opened in the Browser. Login as usual.\n\n\n\nSelect the Fork you created earlier\n\nOnce you are signed in you can select from a list of repositories.\n\n - Select the Fork you created earlier.\n - Select your code root folder.\n\nA folder called open-handbook will be created in that folder and you can open it in VS Code.\n\n\n\n\nEditing\nNow you have a full copy of the Handbook on your laptop. Of course you are not working on the Handbook directly, but on your Fork.\nYou can make changes to the actual Handbook by making changes to your Fork and creating a Pull Request. The Pull Request will be opened in the ubvu open-handbook repository. The editors can then approve your request, perhaps after suggesting some changes, and your changes will be merged to rdm.vu.nl.\nThe handbook is a collaborative effort, multiple people will be making changes to multiple files at the same time. To prevent 2 or more contributors making changes to the same file you should keep the number of files you change in your Pull requests small, preferrably just one page at a time. The best way to do this is to start by creating a branch for the changes you want to make.\n\nCreate a branch\n\n\n\nCreate Branch\n\n\n - Provide a name for the branch. Keep it short and descriptive, this is mainly for yourself so you can easily remember what you created the branch for.\nVS Code will automatically switch to the branch. You can always see the branch you are working on in the bottom left of the Window.\n\n\n\nBranch name\n\n\nYou can click on the name there to switch the branch you are working on.\nRemember your changes are tied to the branch. If you would switch from the zenodo_topic branch to the main branch you will no longer see the changes you made to the Zenodo topic page. But if you have committed your changes they will be visible again once you switch back.\n\n\nEditing the page\nVS Code is basically just a text editor. Open the file you want to work on by double clicking or right click to create a new one in the “Explorer”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe Quarto Extension includes a Visual Editor with which you can format Quarto pages without typing Markdown code.\n\n\n\nWork on your page and save your changes (Click File &gt; Save or use CTRL+S).\n\n\n\n\nChanges\n\n\n\nVS Code will show you the changes with respect to the branch. Now you can commit\n\n\n\nCommit changes\n\nClick on the Git icon on the left.\n\n- Set a short descriptive commit message, click the plus sign next to the files you want in your commit, and click commit.\n By double-clicking on a Modified file you will see a visual representation of your changes.\n\n\nPublish Branch\nNow you have committed your changes to the local git repository on your laptop. You will also need to publish the branch to github, so it gets updated as well.\n\n\n\nPublish Branch\n\n\n You will be able to view the branch on github.\nVS Code will now allow you to Sync (Push and Pull) your commits to the branch on GitHub.\n\n\nCreate a Pull request\nOnce you are happy with the changes you made you can submit a Pull request on GitHub.\n\n\nMore information\nThe VS Code documentation has a nice introduction to Git section with more useful tips.\nThe Quarto tutorial has more tips on using VS Code to edit Quarto pages.\n\n\nUsing the Visual editor\n\n\n\nVisual editor\n\n\n\nTo use the visual editor right-click anywhere in the document you are working on, or use CTRL+SHIFT+F4\n\n\n\n\nFormatting menu\n\n\n\nYou can now format text using a simple menu bar, instead of typing Markdown code."

    "text": "Wat is Yoda?\nYODA is an application for institutions that supports RDM throughout the entire research cycle: from the safe and easy storage and sharing of data during the research process, to the sharing of data within research groups and projects and ultimately to research data archiving and publication\n\n\nHow do I Request Project Space on Yoda?\nEvery VU researcher can request storage space for their projects in Yoda. Requesting space is done via a request form. Please note that because there can be costs involved, you need to supply a budget code. You can find more about the costs involved in the [Cost Model] (https://vu.nl/en/employee/research-data-support/research-archiving-storage-cost-model).\n\n\nHow do I Access Yoda?\nThe Yoda administrator will create a new Yoda Group and folder for you in the system and invite you to this Group. You can then access Yoda via the Yoda Portal at https://portal.yoda.vu.nl/\n\n\nDo I need special credentials to access Yoda?\nAs a VU researcher, once your project space on Yoda is confirmed, you will be able to login using your (primary) e-mail address (no aliases or VUnetId) and password. You can further access your project folder through network drive in your file manager or client software. You can find more information about logging in to the Yoda portal here.\n\n\nCan I Invite others to Collaborate on my Research Projects?\nYes, you can. Once your Project Space is confirmed by the Yoda Administrator, you can invite others to have access to it as well. As project owner, you are automatically designated Group Manager. You can find more information about managing access here.\n\n\nWhat is a Group Manager?\nWithin a Yoda project space, a Group manager is able to grant and revoke access rights for other users to the group. Can also view, download, upload, modify or delete files and folders in the group. A Group Manager will be a Project owner or a Delegate. More information about managing groups, users and access rights can be found here.\n\n\nWhat rights can I grant to those collaborating with me on Yoda Projects?\nProject members with read-only access: are able to view or download files in the group. Regular project members: can view, download, upload, modify or delete files and folders in the project space. More information about managing groups, users and access rights can be found here.\n\n\nIf I revoke rights access from a user, will the data uploaded by that user be deleted?\nNo, the data will not be deleted by revoking a user’s access rights.\n\n\nWhat Type of data may I store on Yoda?\nIt is suitable for sensitive data. Yoda cannot be used for research projects that involve extremely sensitive datasets, such as state secrets or medical information of vulnerable individuals. When in doubt about what type of data you’re dealing with, please consult your Faculty Data Steward and/or Privacy Champion.\n\n\nWhat else can I do on Yoda besides Data Storage?\nIt supports the entire research process from data acquisition to publication. It enables data publication and the associated minting of persistent identifiers (DOIs). It offers support for standardised workflows for the storage and archiving of research data. You can find more information in the [Yoda Topic Page] (https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/yoda.html).\n\n\nWhat is Metadata? And why is it Important when Using Yoda?\nMetadata is “data about data”. Metadata serves multiple purposes in Yoda. Yoda facilitates adding both structured and unstructured metadata to your research data. Entering structured metadata is a prerequisite for archiving a data package. If a folder is published, its structured metadata will be published as well and can be harvested by data catalogs such as DANS NARCIS and DataCite. You can find more information about Metadata [here] (https://rdm.vu.nl/manuals/yoda/using_yoda/metadata.html).\n\n\nWhat is a Data Package?\nThe data in your research data compartment is a set of files and folders. If part of this data is to be archived, the collection of this data, including its folder structure, appropriate metadata, documentation which describes the data in more detail (such as a readme.txt file or codebook files), are collectively referred to as Data Package.\n\n\nHow does Archiving works in Yoda?\nIf you choose to archive a part of your data, Yoda will make a copy of the data to the archive (also known as “Vault”) of your project space, where it will be retained unchanged during its retention period. You can visit the [Vault Page] (https://rdm.vu.nl/manuals/yoda/securing_distribution/vault_archive.html) for more information about archiving data.\n\n\nHow Do I Submit a Data Package to The Vault?\nOnly Group Manager or regular group members may submit data packages to the Vault. Navigate to the folder you want to archive in the Yoda portal. Ensure that you are in the folder which you want to submit to the vault. Check that all mandatory metadata has been entered in the metadata form of the folder. Now press the “Actions (Submit)” button. You can visit the [Vault Page] (https://rdm.vu.nl/manuals/yoda/securing_distribution/vault_archive.html) for more information about archiving data.\n\n\nWhat is the Role of the Data Manager?\nThe data manager will check that the data package is self-evident for other researchers, and will check for compliance with privacy rules and regulations. The data manager can either approve the data package for archiving or suggest improvements.\n\n\nHow Do I Access my Archived Data?\nThe vault of your group becomes visible in the Yoda portal once it contains at least one data package. Everyone with access to your group research folder also has read-only access to the vault of your group.\n\n\nHow does Publishing works in Yoda?\nAfter archiving your data, you can optionally publish it, thus making your data findable. If you classify your data as open - freely retrievable, then the data itself can be downloaded anonymously by any third party.\n\n\nHow Do I Make My Data Package Ready for Publication?\nIf needed, you can update the metadata by clicking the “Metadata” button. To submit a data package for publication, navigate to the data package in the vault and press the “Submit for publication” button. For more information on submitting a dataset for publication you can visit [Publishing Data] (https://rdm.vu.nl/manuals/yoda/securing_distribution/vault_publish.html).\n\n\nWhat is the Process of Data Review for Publication?\nOnce you’ve submitted a data package for publication, the data manager of your Yoda community will be notified. The Data Manager will check that the data package meets various criteria for publication. If the data manager encounters any issues, you will be contacted.\n\n\nHow do I receive the DOI number of my publication?\nOnce the Data Manager has approved your data package, you’ll receive an email notification that your data package has been published. This notification contains the DOI that has been assigned to your data package. You can also find the DOI by going to the Vault dataset in the Yoda webportal.\n\n\nDo I always need to make my Data Package freely available to 3rd parties?\nYou may choose what level of access you assign to your data package. If the [Access Type] metadata field is set to “Open - Freely retrievable”, the data in the data package will be published as well. If the [Access Type] metadata field is set to “Restricted” or “Closed”, the data in the data package won’t be published.\n\n\nI am a VU-student, and I have been invited to join a collaboration in Yoda but I can’t seem to be able to log in\nIt is important to ensure that you have SurfSecure MFA enabled. This is not a standard option for students and requires an appointment with IT Service Desk. Once this is in place you should be able to log into Yoda.

This ensures that other researchers will be able to understand the semantics of the data, the way in which it was collected or generated, and the conditions for (re)use.\n\nFile formats\nA best practice to keep your datasets re-usable is to store your data in open formats. DANS maintains a list of open file formats. If using only open file formats is not feasible, consider exporting each file in a vendor-specific format to an open file format, and storing the exported open format version along with the vendor-specific format version.\nYou can check in Yoda if you are in compliance with either the DANS Preferred formats or the 4TU Preferred formats by pressing the “Actions (Check for compliance with policy)” button.\n\n\n\nActions menu\n\n\nChoose a preferred fomat and the system will show you a list of filetypes in your data folder which are not compliant.\n\n\n\nCheck for DANS compliance",

When using webDAV this is also true on the server side (Yoda) this includes server name, project name and project folders. Be careful when copying deep directory structures and very long filenames to Yoda using Cyberduck and webDAV. Fortunately, Cyberduck will display an error message and not copy theile when either trying to copy a file with a too long source or destination path. This error is typically “access denied” (403 or 500) error and if you click “continue” Cyberduck simply skips that file and it is not transferred to Yoda.\nRecommendation. If you get “access denied errors” when transferring files with Cyberduck - Make a note of which files fail to copy. - Flatten the directory structure or shorten the filename. - Zip the “main” directory branch(es) that contain the long path names into individual ZIP archives.",

Examples are the title of the data package, its creator, the retention period of the package, etc.\nWhen a data package is published, Yoda makes the structured metadata available for harvesting by data catalogs, such as DataCite.\nUnstructured metadata is intended to provide more detailed information about the data. This information can be in a README.TXT or other file that is included as part of the data package. The format of this file is chosen by the researcher. Users will need to open and inspect the data package to find this metadata. Unstructured metadata can include information about (for example) the experimental design, data transformation, sampling method, etc.\nYou can read more in-depth information about metadata on the dedicated page",

This means that you can restore many revisions from the same day, less revisions from the last few days, even less revisions from a week back, etcetera. After 16 weeks, every revision older than 16 weeks is deleted.\nFollow these steps to restore up to 16 weeks older file versions:\n\nGo to the Yoda portal and sign in.\nClick on ‘Research’ in the menu (the black bar).

It is good practice to first determine your workflow in a single-threaded fashion (no distribution of compute), and then identify parts that can be distributed over multiple processors at the same time. More extensive tutorials on how to do this will follow soon. The most important points for now to get you started:\n\nDetermine your input, output and temporary data. Use the fast scratch directory ($TMPDIR, also see Basic Slurm Job) on the compute nodes if you handle large datasets or if you have to perform intermediate I/O operations. Be aware that the scratch directory is not persistent, data will be removed from it after the job finishes.\nAlways specify the –output and –error flags in your Slurm script for debugging purposes.\nThe bigger your allocation requests, the longer you might have to wait to get those resources. Split your jobs in smaller chunks if possible (e.g. by using job arrays)\nCheck your code on style and execution. Do you clear memory when necessary? Are your I/O operations finished correctly before the end of your script?"

    "section": "Complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)",
    "text": "Complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)\nWhen scientific research includes the processing of personal data, conducting a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may be a legal requirement under the GDPR. If it is not a legal requirement, conducting a DPIA is always a helpful exercise to make sure that you address all legal aspects that need to be addressed. It is the best way to GDPR-proof your research.\n\nWhat is a DPIA?\nA DPIA is an assessment to identify the risks of processing personal data. It consists of a number of questions on the basis of which you determine whether the processing of personal data in your research project is legitimate and which measures should be taken to make sure this processing takes place within the boundaries of the GDPR. A DPIA doesn’t deliver an automatic report at the end, but it rather makes you think about all relevant topics you need to address before starting the processing of personal data. The outcome of a DPIA should be used to determine appropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks, such as data minimisation (not collecting more data than necessary), pseudonymising data, selecting appropriate tools for data storage and data sharing.\n\n\nWhen is a DPIA required?\nA DPIA is required when the processing of personal data is likely to result in a “high risk” for the participants of your research project. This is for example most likely the case when scientific research includes the processing of special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, religious or philosophical beliefs, political opinions or criminal convictions and offences (see Privacy in Research - 10 key rules for more information about special categories of personal data).\nThere are two DPIA lists which describe situations in which a DPIA is required:\n\nThe Dutch data protection authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) has published a list of 17 “high risk” situations in which a DPIA is mandatory.\nThe European data protection authorities have together published a list of 9 criteria which can be used to determine whether there is a “high risk”.\n\nYou should consult your 🔒 Privacy Champion to determine whether a PreDPIA is required in your situation.\n\n\nHow can I complete a DPIA?\nVU Amsterdam has a DPIA template based on a form provided by the Dutch Government (see the original template if you wish to have more background information, only available in Dutch).\nYou should request the template from your 🔒 Privacy Champion.\nPlease complete a DPIA at least before you start collecting personal data. In some cases, it might be useful to have a look at the DPIA template at the stage of writing a research proposal.\nIf you are not sure whether it is required to conduct a DPIA or if you need help completing a DPIA, please contact your faculty’s 🔒 Privacy Champion. If needed they can contact the legal specialists of Institutional and Legal Affairs."

    "section": "Storing vs. Archiving Data",
    "text": "Storing vs. Archiving Data\nThere is a difference between storing and archiving data. Storing refers to putting the data in a safe location while the research is ongoing. Because you are still working on the data, the data still change from time to time: they are cleaned, and analysed, and this analysis generates output. As the image below illustrates, storing could be like cooking a dish: you are cleaning and combining ingredients.\nArchiving, on the other hand, refers to putting the data in a safe place after the research is finished. The data are in a fixed state, they don’t change anymore. Archiving is done for verification purposes: so others can check that your research is sound. Or: it is done so that others can reuse the resulting dataset. There is also a difference between archiving and publishing, but in essence, archiving and publishing happen at a similar moment and for both, data do not change anymore.\n\n\n\nA Scriberia illustration showing storage on the left, in a kitchen space with storage making things available, and archiving on the right, in a museum where it is available for viewing.\n\n\nThis illustration is created by Scriberia with The Turing Way community. Used under a CC-BY 4.0 licence. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807\n\nSelecting Data for Archiving\nThere are various reasons to archive your data: replication, longitudinal research, data being unique or expensive to collect, re-usability and acceleration of research inside or outside your own discipline. It is VU policy to archive your data for (at least) 10 years after the last publication based on the dataset. Part of preparing your dataset for archiving is appraising and selecting your data.\n\nMake a selection before archiving your data\nDuring your research you may accumulate a lot of data, some of which will be eligible for archiving. It is impossible to preserve all data infinitely. Archiving all digital data leads to high costs for storage itself and for maintaining and managing this ever-growing volume of data and their metadata; it may also lead to decline in discoverability (see the website of the Digital Curation Centre). For those reasons, it is crucial that you make a selection.\n\n\nRemove redundant and sensitive data\nSelecting data means making choices about what to keep for the long term, and what data to archive securely and what data to publish openly. This means that you have to decide whether your dataset contains data that need to be removed or separated. Reasons to exclude data from publishing include (but are not limited to):\n\ndata are redundant\ndata concern temporary byproducts which are irrelevant for future use\ndata contain material that is sensitive, for example personal data in the sense of the GDPR, like consent forms, voice recordings, DNA data; state secrets; data that are sensitive to competition in a commercial sense. These data need to be separated from other data and archived securely\npreserving data for the long term is in breach of contractual arrangements with your consortium partners or other parties involved\n\nIn preparing your dataset for archiving, the first step is to determine which parts of your data are sensitive, which can then be separated from the other data. Redundant data can be removed altogether.\n\n\nDifferent forms of datasets for different purposes\nOnce you have separated the sensitive data from the rest of your dataset, you have to think about what to do with these sensitive materials. In some cases they may be destroyed, but you may also opt for archiving multiple datasets. For example, you may want to archive your dataset in more than one form depending on the purpose. For example:\n\nOne for reusability to share\nA second one that contains the sensitive data, and needs to be handled differently.\n\nFor the first, the non-sensitive data can be stored in an archive under restricted or open access conditions, so that you can share it and link it to publications. For the second, you need to make a separate selection, so the sensitive part can be stored safely in a secure archive (a so-called offline or dark archive). In the metadata of both archives you can create stable links between the two datasets using persistent identifiers.\n\n\nWhat to appraise for archiving\nThere are several factors that determine what data to select for archiving. For example, whether data are unique, expensive to reproduce, or if your funder requires that you make your data publicly available. This might also help you or your department to think about a standard policy or procedures for what needs to be kept, what is vital for reproducing research or reuse in future research projects.\nMore information on selecting data:\n\nTjalsma, H. & Rombouts, J. (2011). Selection of research data: Guidelines for appraising and selecting research data. Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS).\nDigital Curation Centre (DCC): Whyte, A. & Wilson, A. (2010). How to appraise and select research data for curation. DCC How-to Guides. Edinburgh: Digital Curation Centre.\nResearch Data Netherlands: Data selection.\n\n\n\n\nData Set Packaging: Which Files should be Part of my Dataset?\nA dataset consists of the following documents:\n\nRaw or cleaned data (if the cleaned data has been archived, the provenance documentation is also required)\nProject documentation\nCodebook or protocol\nLogbook or lab journal (when available, dependent on the discipline)\nSoftware (& version) needed to open the files when no preferred formats for the data can be provided\n\nSee the topic Metadata for more information about documenting your data.\nDepending on the research project it may be that more than one dataset is stored in more than one repository. Make sure that each consortium partner that collects data also stores all necessary data that is required for transparency and verification. A Consortium Agreement and Data Management Plan will include information on who is responsible for archiving the data."

In the context of research data and software, it is essentially a URL that will never break. By using a Persistent Identifier, you make sure that your dataset will be findable well into the future when it is registered online (for example at DataCite. Another advantage is that it makes a digital object citable.\n\nMultiple PID systems\nThere are multiple PID systems, each with its own particular properties. Examples of widely used PIDs in the research domain include the following.\n\nDOI: A Digital Object Identifier can be used to refer to research data, research software and publications.\nORCiD: An Open Researcher and Contributor ID is used to create a researcher profile with a unique identification number.\nROR: The Research Organization Registry is a global register with persistent identifiers for research institutes.\n\nSee the Persistent Identifier guide of Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed for a more elaborate overview. Apart from widely used domain-agnostic PIDs, there is a wide range of domain-specific unique identifiers that can be used. If you are interested in domain-specific identifiers, it is useful to ask colleagues in your department or discipline.\n\n\nPersistent Identifiers for data and software in repositories\nPersistent Identifiers can be assigned to datasets and software upon their deposit in a repository. In many repositories, this is a DOI. Data repositories are entitled to generate Persistent Identifiers for data and software. This is one of the reasons why archiving and publishing data and software has to be done in a repository. After the process of uploading data or software to a repository, a Persistent Identifier will be generated. Upon publishing the data or software, the DOI is registered online (usually at DataCite when it concerns a dataset).\nSome repositories enable their users to reserve a Persistent Identifier before the publishing process has finished, so that you can include the Persistent Identifier in a publication before the data will be actually published, or to include the Persistent Identifier in a readme file. This is for example possible in Zenodo.\nThe repositories offered by VU Amsterdam, Yoda and DataverseNL provide DOIs for deposited datasets and software.\n\n\nCreating and using an ORCiD\nResearchers can use an ORCiD to identify their research output as their work. You can request an ORCiD yourself. Instructions for setting up an ORCiD and connecting it to your VU research profile in PURE are available in this ORCiD LibGuide. An ORCiD is often asked for when you submit a publication or upload data or software to a repository. You can use your ORCiD record to create a research profile as well.\n\n\nUsing a ROR\nResearchers can use the ROR for VU Amsterdam when filling metadata forms for their research output to show that their work has been created within their employment at VU Amsterdam."

    "section": "Data Documentation",
    "text": "Data Documentation\nBy creating documentation about your research data you can make it easier for yourself or for others to manage, find, assess and use your data. The process of documenting means to describe your data and the methods by which they were collected, processed and analysed. The documentation or descriptions are also referred to as metadata, i.e. data about data. These metadata can take various forms and can describe data on different levels.\nAn example that is frequently used to illustrate the importance of metadata is the use of the label on a can of soup. The label tells you what kind of soup the can contains, what ingredients are used, who made it, when it expires and how you should prepare the soup for consumption.\nWhen you are documenting data, you should take into account that there are different kinds of metadata and that these metadata are governed by various standards. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nFAIR data principles: a set of principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.\nGuidelines for unstructured metadata: mostly research domain-specific guidelines on how to create READMEs or Codebooks to describe data.\nStandards for structured metadata: generic or research domain-specific standards to describe data.\n\nThe CESSDA has made very detailed guidance available for creating documentation and metadata for your data.\n\n\n\nA layered diagram with the FAIR principles as the outermost layer, followed by an inner layer for Metadata. Within Metadata there are two separate cores, one for unstructured and one for structured metadata. Unstructured metadata contains README and codebook; Structured metadata contains Generic and Specific.\n\n\n\nFAIR data principles\nThe FAIR data principles provide guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. The principles emphasise machine-actionability, i.e., the capacity of computational systems to find, access, interoperate, and reuse data with none or minimal human intervention.\nMore information can be found in the section about the FAIR data principles.\n\n\nUnstructured metadata\nMost data documentation is an example of unstructured metadata. Unstructured metadata are mainly intended to provide more detailed information about the data and is primarily readable for humans. The type of research and the nature of the data influence what kind of unstructured metadata is necessary. Unstructured metadata are attached to the data in a file. The format of the file is chosen by the researcher. More explanation about structured metadata can be found on the metadata page.\n\nREADME\nA README file provides information about data and is intended to ensure that data can be correctly interpreted, by yourself or by others. A README file is required whenever you are archiving or publishing data.\nExample of READMEs\n\nGuidelines for creating a README file – 4TU.ResearchData\nGuide to writing “readme”-style metatada - Cornell Data Services\nGuidelines for researchers of VU Amsterdam Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences on what a README file should contain\n\n\n\nCodebook\nA Codebook is another way to describe the contents, structure and layout of the data. A well documented codebook is intended to be complete and self-explanatory and contains information about each variable in a data file. A codebook must be submitted along with the data.\nThere are several guides for creating a codebook available:\n\nCreating a codebook - Kent State University\nCreating a codebook - for researchers at VU Amsterdam Faculty for Behavioural and Movement Sciences\nCodebook - Amsterdam Public Health\nDDI-Codebook - Data Documentation Initiative Alliance"

    "section": "Metadata",
    "text": "Metadata\nMetadata provide information about your data. Structured metadata are intended to provide this information in a standardised way. The structured metadata are readable for both humans and machines. It can be used by data catalogues, for example DataCite Commons.\nThe standardisation of metadata involves the following aspects:\n\nElements: rules about the fields that must be used to describe an object, for example the title, author and publicationDate.\nValues: rules about the values that must be used within specific elements. Controlled vocabularies, classifications and Persistent Identifiers are used to reduce ambiguity and ensure consistency, for example by using a term from a controlled vocabulary like the Medical Subject HEadings (MeSH) as a subject and a Persistent Identifier such as an ORCID to identify a person.\nFormats: rules about the formats used to exchange metadata, for example JSON or XML.\n\n\nMetadata standards\nMetadata standards allow for easier exchange of metadata and harvesting of the metadata by search engines. Many certified archives use a metadata standard for the descriptions. If you choose a data repository or registry, you should find out which metadata standard they use. At VU Amsterdam the following standards are used:\n\nYoda uses the DataCite metadata standard\nDataverseNL uses the Dublin Core metadata standard\nVU Amsterdam Research Information System PURE uses the CERIF metadata standard\n\nMany archives implement or make use of specific metadata standards. The UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provides an overview of metadata standards for different disciplines. The list is a great and useful resource in establishing and carrying out your research methodology.\n\n\nControlled Vocabularies & Classifications\nControlled vocabularies are lists of terms created by domain experts to refer to a specific phenomenon or event. Controlled vocabularies are intended to reduce ambiguity that is inherent in normal human languages where the same concept can be given different names and to ensure consistency. Controlled vocabularies are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri, taxonomies and other knowledge organisation systems. Some vocabularies are very internationally accepted and standardised and may even become an ISO standard or a regional standard/classification. Controlled vocabularies can be broad in scope or very limited to a specific field. When a Data Management Plan template includes a question on the used ontology (if any), what is usually meant is: is there a specific vocabulary or classification system used? The National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden gives some more explanation about controlled vocabularies and ontologies. In short, an ontology does not only describe terms, but also indicates relationships between these terms.\nExamples of controlled vocabularies are:\n\nCDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art)\nGetty Thesaurus of Geographic names\nNUTS (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics)\nMedical Subject HEadings (MeSH)\nThe Environment Ontology (EnvO)\n\nMany examples of vocabularies and classification systems can be found at the FAIRsharing.org website. It has a large list for multiple disciplines. If you are working on new concepts or new ideas and are using or creating your own ontology/terminology, be sure to include them as part of the metadata documentation in your dataset (for example as part of your codebook).\n\n\nMetadata levels\nFinally a distinction can be made on the level of description. Metadata can be about the data as a whole or about part of the data. It can depend on the research domain and the tools that are used on how many levels the data can be described. In repositories like Yoda and DataverseNL it is common practice to only create structured metadata on the level of the data as a whole. The Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) explains this distinction for several types of data in their Data Management Expert Guide.\n\n\n\nFlowchart indicating a project with a Folder a and Folder b, where Folder a has File 1 and File 2. The project, Folder a, and File 1, have linked metadata to them.\n\n\n\n\nDataset registration\nWhen you want to make sure that your dataset is findable it is recommended that the elements of the description of your dataset are made according to a certain metadata standard that allows for easier exchange of metadata and harvesting of the metadata by search engines. Many certified archives use a metadata standard for the descriptions. If you choose a data repository or registry, you should find out which metadata standard they use. At VU Amsterdam the following standards are used:\n\nDataverseNL and DANS use the Dublin Core metadata standard\nVU Amsterdam Research Portal PURE uses the CERIF metadata standard\n\nMany archives implement or make use of specific metadata standards. The UK Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provides an overview of metadata standards for different disciplines. The list is a great and useful resource in establishing and carrying out your research methodology. Go to the overview of metadata standards.

    "section": "Data Licensing",
    "text": "Data Licensing\n\nIntroduction\nA data licence agreement is a legal instrument that lets others know what they can and cannot do with a particular dataset (and any documentation, scripts and metadata that are published with the data - information about software licensing can be found on the software licensing page). It is important to consider what kind of limitations are relevant. Usually, at least the following questions are considered:\n\nCan people make copies or even distribute copies?\nDo others (and you) reusing the dataset need to acknowledge you as the author of the original dataset? (This is called Attribution.)\nDo others (and you) who reuse the dataset and/or make derivatives of the dataset need to share their work under a similar licence? (This is called Share-Alike.)\nCan others (and you) use your dataset commercially? (A restriction on commercial use is called Non-Commercial.)\nCan others (and you) create a new work based on the dataset? (This is called a Derivative.)\n\nThe considerations above are the ‘building blocks’ that Creative Commons licences use. There are also other considerations, and also other licences.\n\n\n\nAn image of open data, made up of public domain icons\n\n\n\n\nReusing existing data\nIf you wish to reuse data collected by others (this could be data you received from for example Statistics Netherlands or from a company, a dataset you have found in an online repository, commonly used databases for which VU Amsterdam has a licence, etc.), make sure that you read the licence or terms of use. Also make sure that you work with the data according to the licence or terms of use. This can mean different things depending on the licence, but common things to consider are for example:\n\ncite the data in an appropriate manner;\ndo not share the data beyond the project/purpose for which you received them;\nshare the outcome of your research based on the data under a similar licence;\nonly use them for scientific purposes (and not for commercial purposes, for example).\n\nIf you have questions about the legal context of using an existing dataset, you can contact the RDM Support Desk or the legal experts at IXA VU.\n\n\nLicensing data\nIf you want to make your data available for other (research) purposes, it is important to apply a licence to it. Without a licence, it is impossible for others to reuse your data without your explicit approval. When you deposit your data in a repository, the repository will usually ask you to select a standard licence, or to create and add a custom licence yourself. If you need help with drawing up licence agreements, you can contact the VU’s legal office.\n\nDataverseNL\nIn DataverseNL you can choose your terms of use when uploading data to the repository. The DataverseNL user guide explains how licensing works in the repository.\n\n\nYoda\nIf you publish your data in Yoda, there is guidance available on how to choose a licence and how to customise licences.\n\n\nOpen Science Framework (OSF)\nIn OSF, you can apply a standard licence to your materials or upload your own custom licence. The OSF user guide explains both options.\n\n\nExternal repositories\nSome data repositories require you to use a certain licence if you want to deposit your data with them. At Dryad, for example, all datasets are published under the terms of Creative Commons Zero to minimise legal barriers and to maximise the impact for research and education. Some funders may also require that you publish the data as open data. Open data are data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share alike (Open Knowledge International definition).\n\n\n\nAdditional websites and tools:\n\nExplanation about copyrights and licences by a professor from Leiden University (English subtitles available)\nThe Guide to Creative Commons for Scholarly Publishing and Educational Resources by NWO, VSNU and the University and Royal Libraries\nDCC how-to guide on licensing research data, a guide that links to the Creative Commons website, where many terms are explained\nOpen Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)\nEUDAT B2SHARE licence selection wizard, which Pawel Kamocki (et al.) released under an open source licence.1"

This can be a Data Steward, Data Manager or RDM coordinator. The VU website provides a list of all faculty support professionals.\n\n\nRDM Support Desk and library support professionals\nThe RDM Support Desk provides practical assistance, help and advice with any RDM- and RDM tools related questions, for example about: writing a data management plan, making your research FAIR, grants and RDM costs, training and workshops, data storage, data and software archiving and publishing, GDPR and the use of RDM tools like Yoda and Research Drive. In case your faculty or institute does not have a designated support officer, the RDM Support Desk is the go-to place.\nYou can contact the RDM Support Desk via the VU Research Data Support service portal (only for VU employees) or via rdm@vu.nl. You can also find a list of professionals of the RDM Support Desk on the VU website.\n\n\nPrivacy Champions\nPrivacy Champions are colleagues who are the first point of contact for all questions regarding privacy and data protection related topics. They can help you with the most common privacy questions, for example: can we process this personal data without consent of the data subjects? Is this software application suitable for the processing of sensitive personal data? An overview of all faculty and department Privacy Champions is provided on the 🔒 Privacy Champion who-is-who page.\n\n\nIT for Research (ITvO)\nThe expertise center research IT is a primary point of contact for questions related to compute services, high performance computing and local storage of large data volumes. ITvO will help you to find a suitable technical solution or support for your research group or project. You can find more information about the VU Compute Hub, the ADA high performance compute cluster, the VU local storage solution SciStor and server capacity on SciCloud in other Handbook topics. You can read more about the services ITvO provides on the ITvO topic page.\n\n\nVU Grants Office\nThe Grants Office provides advice on various types of national and international, individual and consortium grants: From complex multidisciplinary applications with multiple partners such as Horizon Europe, NWO Gravitation and NWA, to renowned individual grants such as NWO Veni, Vidi, Vici and ERC Starting, Consolidator and Advanced grants. The Grants Office gives advice throughout the grant application process and during the term of the subsidy. You can read more about the VU Grants Office on the 🔒 VU Amsterdam Grants Office page.\n\n\nLegal advice\nIf you need advice on legal and administrative matters, you can contact the team of Institutional and Legal Affairs. This is the VU legal enquiry centre. They can provide advice on a wide range of issues, for example: How do you arrange for personal data to be processed safely and carefully? How to set up contracts in collaborative research projects? What happens with the research results? Can each party use the other parties’ results? You can find out more about legal support at the Institutional and Legal Affairs pages.\n\n\nInformation Security Officers (ISOs)\nBefore the start of a new research project, it is necessary to assess the risks associated with the data that will be collected and/or used in the project. Classifying research data enables researchers to protect the data in an appropriate manner. What is relevant, is that the security level matches the identified risks. This enables the researcher to determine where the data may or may not be processed and under which conditions.\nThe IT Information and Security Officers (ISO) can help you with these security matters related to data protection and the use of the right software solutions. The RDM Support Desk or a faculty Privacy Champion is the first point of contact on these matters. If necessary, they will contact the ISO Office for further advice.\nOther helping aids in data-classification and classification policies are the Data Classification Tool and the Policy Classification of Research Data."

The guide is written for social science researchers who are in an early stage of practising research data management. The guide describes a lot of practical approaches to research data management which are useful for other domains as well.\nGO FAIR is a stakeholder-driven and self-governed initiative that aims to implement the FAIR principles. It offers numerous resources about how to make research data FAIR and how to organise communities.\nThe course Essentials 4 Data Support, developed by Research Data Netherlands, is an introductory program designed for professionals who want to assist researchers in storing, managing, archiving, and sharing their research data. Although the course is designed for data support professionals, it provides many online useful resources on various data management topics for researchers as well."

E.g. data capture and cleaning, data curation and preservation, data sharing.\nInclude budget for long-term storage if data are expected to be deposited in a repository not funded by the university or external funders (VU repositories are: DataverseNL, Yoda). 🔒 VU has an internal breakdown of costs for storage and archiving for VU-managed storage and repositories.\n\nA practical costing tool is available from the UK Data Archive. Based on this costing tool, Utrecht University has developed a guide to calculate the costs of data management. You can use those guides as well to estimate the costs needed specifically for RDM.\nMost material costs of the storage solutions offered by VU Amsterdam are covered centrally (up to 500 GB), but if you need to specify the costs for your project, look at the 🔒 Research & Archiving Storage Cost Model\nExamples to put in a data management plan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Stage\nDataset\nType of data\nCosts\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\nInterviews\nAudio files\nAudio equipment rental\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation rental costs\n\n\n\n\n\nData storage & backup\n\n\nProcessed data\nTranscription of interviews\nWord files\nPersonnel costs: hiring research assistants for manual entry\n\n\n\n\n\nData storage & backup\n\n\n\nAnalysis software\nR script\nPersonnel costs: programmer to write a programme to mine the data\n\n\nAnalysed data\nRegression graphic\nPhotoshop files\nSoftware costs\n\n\n\nProject Website\nHTML, Java\nHosting fee\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel to build initial website"

    "text": "Data Management Plan\nIf you receive funding from a funder, one of the early deliverables will be a Data Management Plan. In general, every research benefits from writing a data management plan. It will help you to address data management aspects in a systematic way, so that you can set up useful RDM practices for your research and identify potential things for which you need to arrange something, like sufficient storage space, a particular data collection methodology, etc.\n\nWhat is a DMP\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document outlining how research data will be handled throughout the research life cycle. A DMP is a structured way to address data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation. It also outlines the measures taken to ensure data security and addresses how data will be preserved and made available for future use.\n\n\nDMPonline\nVU Amsterdam offers the online tool DMPonline for writing Data Management Plans. DMPonline is a platform that offers a range of templates, ensuring that researchers can create DMPs to meet the standards of diverse funders and institutions associated with their projects. DMPonline makes it easy to work on a DMP together with colleagues, advisors, or other stakeholders. VU Amsterdam researchers can use the request feedback function of DMPonline to get their DMP reviewed by a faculty data steward or RDM Support Desk colleague.\nInstructions for selecting the right DMP template in DMPonline are available in the guide How can you set up research data management from the start?.\nIf you have questions about DMPonline, or encounter problems when using the tool, please get in touch with rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\nWhat is data\nResearch data is any information that has been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings. Examples of data could be interview recordings, experiment results, physical measurement, notes from focus group’s meetings, notes from fieldwork, observations captured in photographs, film or audio, text files extracted from a corpus, image of archival items or artworks, scraped websites, responses to survey questions. Algorithms, simulations, code, scripts and software are often also considered as research data. There is also physical data: (biological) samples, collections, artifacts etc.\nAdministrative documents, like informed consent forms and key files should be acknowledged as important elements of research data as well.\n\n\nData Assets\nAt VU Amsterdam, we sometimes use the term ‘Data Assets’. You can think of data assets as small ‘parcels’ of data that can change form or format throughout the research. For example, if you’re sending out surveys for your research, the survey responses are considered a data asset. If, in addition to the surveys, you’re also holding focus groups, the data collected from the focus group are also considered a data asset, separate from the survey results. Most projects will have more than one data asset per data stage. It is common to provide data assets based on the data stage such as raw, processed, or analysed. Raw Data refers to original data collected, Processed Data is data that has undergone some level of transformation or organisation. Processing involves cleaning, formatting, and structuring raw data to make them more understandable and suitable for analysis. Analysed Data usually results from statistical methods, detailed examination or interpretation.\nHere are some examples of data assets in research data management:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Stage\nDataset description\nType of data\nFormat\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\nInterviews\nAudio files\nMP3\n\n\n\nSpectographic analysis\nText files\nCSV\n\n\nProcessed data\nTranscription of interviews\nText files\nDocx\n\n\n\nData spreadsheet\nSPSS files\nSAV\n\n\nAnalysed data\nRegression graphic\nGraph\nPNG\n\n\n\nData table\nWord file\nDocx\n\n\nOther\nPoster presentation\nPowerpoint\nPPS\n\n\n\nProject Website\nHTML\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis code\nText files\nPython\n\n\n\nNote that these data assets also change in the different phases of the research! While the interview data are audio files in the raw stage, they are transcribed and become text files in the processed stage.\n\n\nDMP Elements\nVU Amsterdam DMP template consists of seven sections with questions. In DMPonline, there is guidance available for all sections, as well as example answers. When you are writing your DMP, you can consult this information directly in DMPonline. Below we provide references to information and support available for various RDM-related aspects.\n\nLegal and ethical requirements\n\nWorking with personal data\nIf you have questions about working with personal data in research, please get in touch with the Privacy Champion of your faculty. The 🔒 overview of Privacy Champions can be found on VU Amsterdam website. Make sure to contact your Privacy Champion in the following situations:\n\nIf you need to carry out a DPIA, or if you’re unsure if you need to do one\nIf you work with special category personal data, or otherwise very sensitive data\nIf you are collaborating with other parties\nIf you need software for which no licence is set up on behalf of VU Amsterdam\nIf you wish to reuse existing data containing personal data\n\nIt is impossible to provide an overview of tasks to be carried out to ensure compliance with the GDPR that fits all research projects. For that reason, it is important to contact your Privacy Champion. They will be able to identify what needs to be arranged to adhere to the GDPR.\n\n\nEthical Review\nIn cases where research involves human or animal participants, a research proposal may need to be reviewed by an ethics committee. VU Amsterdam and Amsterdam UMC (location VUmc), have several ethics committees, which are listed below. Please note that researchers at VU Amsterdam also have to go to the METc at VUmc if their research is subject to the WMO, which is not restricted to research at VUmc.\n\nEthics committees\n\nACTA: ACTA Ethics Review Board (ETC), Academisch Centrum Tandheelkunde Amsterdam\nBeta: Research ethics review committee Faculty of Science (BETHCIE), Faculty of Science\nFGB: 🔒 Scientific and Ethical Review Board (VCWE), Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences\nFSG, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities:\n\nSGW: Ethische Toetsingscommissie Onderzoek (EtCO), School of Humanities\nSSW: 🔒 Research Ethics Review Committee (RERC), School of Social Sciences\n\nRCH: Ethics Committee, Faculty of Law\nSBE: Ethical Review Board (ERB), School of Business and Economics\nVUmc (Amsterdam UMC): Medical Ethical Review Committee (METc)\n\n\n\n\n\nStorage and backup during the research process\nAn overview of storage facilities at VU Amsterdam is available in the Data Storage Finder. You can use this as a starting point to navigate storage solutions.\nIf you have questions about data storage and backup, send an email to rdm@vu.nl.\n\n\nData archiving and publishing\nIf your research data contains personal data and you’re unsure about which data may be published, please contact your 🔒 Privacy Champion.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right template\nVarious templates exist in which you can set up your DMP. We strongly recommend that you use the VU template, which is called VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified) v1.4. Below you’ll find an explanation of how to access this template. If you need to write a DMP for funding agencies NWO, ZonMw or ERC, you can use the VU template as well.\n\nVU template\nYou can find the VU DMP template in DMPonline. It includes concise guidance on how to complete your DMP.\nYou can select the VU template by taking the following steps (see also the picture below).\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect the following template: ‘1 - VU DMP template 2021 (NWO & ZonMw certified v1.4’).\nClick ‘Create’.\n\nNote: Follow these steps as well if you receive funding from NWO, ZonMw or ERC (see also below).\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a form for creating a data management plan, asking for the research project and what template you would like to use.\n\n\nIf you’re aiming to write a full DMP based on VU Amsterdam DMP template, please make sure you don’t select the GDPR registration form.\n\n\n\nA screenshot highlighting to not use VU Amsterdam GDPR Registration form\n\n\n\n\nFunder template\nWe recommend researchers to use VU Amsterdam DMP template whenever possible, especially for researchers who work with personal data. The VU DMP template includes questions that serve as input for the GDPR record of processing activities. This means that when you write a DMP based on the VU DMP template, you simultaneousely comply with the VU requirement to register the personal data you use in your research.\nHowever, it is also possible to use other templates in DMPonline. If your funder or partner organisation requires you to use a certain template, it is possible to select that template in DMPonline. Please follow the steps below to select a funder’s template.\n\nOn your dashboard, click on Create plan.\nEnter the title of your research project (you don’t have to select the check box for mock testing).\nSelect the template of your funder from the list.\nClick ‘Create’.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of a filled out form for creating a data management plan, with example data included.\n\n\nResearchers who don’t work with personal data and who wish to use another DMP template than the VU template, can also follow the steps above.\n\n\nGDPR registration form\nIf you work with personal data, you need to register your processing activities. If you don’t need to write a (new) DMP, you can use the VU GDPR registration form for research v1.1. Your faculty’s 🔒 Privacy Champion can help you with your registration."

    "section": "RDM Requirements",
    "text": "RDM Requirements\nIf you do research at VU Amsterdam, you may be subject to the requirements for Research Data Management formulated by various parties. Please check which requirements apply to your research project.\nMany funders have specific requirements for RDM. The exact requirements vary by funder. They usually include a Data Management Section in the project proposal and a Data Management Plan (DMP) after funding has been granted. As funding agencies invest financially in your research project, they often have demands concerning research integrity, data quality, data publication and reusability. As research output, data are often compared to a kind of public good that should be made available to the community for re-use if possible. Always check what demands are set by a funder before you apply.\n\nFunding agencies\n\nData management section in project proposal\nAt a grant application, some funders request a short data section in your project proposal or an outline of a Data Management Plan. Without these your proposal will not be eligible for review.\n\nNWO: Data management section\nZonMw: Orientation of data management in project proposal\n\n\n\nData Management Plan\nIn a Data Management Plan (DMP; see also the section Data Management Plan) you explain how you will handle your research data. Check with your funder at what stage a DMP has to be submitted and how it should be composed. VU has a DMP template that has been acknowledged by NWO, ZonMw and ERC. We recommend you to use this VU template. See the DMP page for more information and instructions on how to select this template in DMPonline.\nThe tool DMPonline can be used to access and fill in a DMP template. You can also write a DMP in collaboration and invite a third party to comment or give feedback on your DMP. You can use the button ‘Request feedback’ to ask for feedback from a data steward. In order to write a DMP, you need to create your own account.\n\n\nOverview of funders’ RDM requirements and DMP templates\nThe Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) presents a comprehensive overview of data management requirements and templates of the main Dutch and European funding bodies. This is helpful if you want to quickly find more information. However, make sure you always check the details that you receive in the documentation of your actual funding agency, so that you are aware of all up-to-date requirements.\n\nNational: NWO, ZonMw\n\n\n\nPublishing your data and terms of use\nNormally a funder requires you to publish your data in a data repository at the end of the project (unless this is prohibited by legislation). For that reason, DMP templates usually include the following questions:\n\nwhere your dataset can be found\nwhether your dataset has a Persistent Identifier\nhow your data are documented\nwhether your data may be reused freely or not and which terms and conditions apply\n\nPlease consider your funder’s data publishing requirements, so that you can take the necessary steps before and during your research project. For example, if you are working with personal data and you want to publish them in a data repository, this needs to be included in the informed consent forms that your participants have to sign.\n\n\n\nLocal requirements from your university and faculty\nVU Amsterdam is committed to support research that meets the highest requirements of replicability and transparency. The FAIR data principles, the purpose of which is to render research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the principles of Open Science are at the foundation of the Research Data Management (RDM) policy of VU Amsterdam.\nIn addition to the central policy for RDM, faculties of VU Amsterdam also have developed their own implementation of this policy.\nPlease check the relevant local policies and Standard Operating Procedures relevant for your faculty or department before you start your research project. An overview of all available policy documents can be found in the section VU policies and regulations.\n\n\nConsortium partners\nPartner institutions in a consortium may also have research data management requirements, for example with respect to data security. They may ask for:\n\ncertification in relation to data security of VU Amsterdam’s infrastructure\nstatements from the IT department about the IT systems being used at VU Amsterdam\n\nThe RDM Support Desk or your faculty’s research support office can help you with this."

Be sure to indicate exactly who is responsible for collecting and managing the data in each case, where, and how. If more than one organisation is involved, it may also be necessary to create a Consortium Agreement. Depending on the area or sector of each project and of the degree of technical complexity that is involved, the Consortium Agreement usually contains the following information:\n\nprovisions on the governance structure of the consortium;\ntechnical provisions (e.g. the tasks of each party and the project schedule, description of the data collection responsibilities);\nfinancial provisions (e.g. the distribution of funds among participants, the financial plan, etc).\n\nThe agreement can include a section on who is ultimately responsible for the data and whether the data will be shared afterwards or whether certain restrictions on re-use apply. These restrictions can also be related to copyright issues or pending patent requests. IXA can help you to draw up a consortium agreement. The RDM Support Desk at the University Library can also help with questions about legal matters.\nIf you are working with personal data, GDPR requires that all parties working with the data sign a joint controller agreement. You can ask your 🔒 Privacy Champion for advice about this. For multi-centre clinical research, a Clinical Trial Agreement is recommended.\nFor projects funded by the European Union, several sources are available:\n\nFor Horizon 2020 projects a document is available, called “Guidance How to draw up your consortium agreement”."

    "section": "Data Security",
    "text": "Data Security\n\nData classification\n‘Security’ is often regarded as a fixed state. Therefore, people tend to think of security measures as fixed solutions in the form of technological measures. In reality, security is an assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat, that you consider to deal with that threat adequately enough. Whether or not security is accurate depends on the value of the data and the quality of protective measures.\nThe value of data or applications is established through classification in Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) or in Dutch Beschikbaarheid, Integriteit en Vertrouwelijkheid (BIV).\nTraditionally, this classification assesses the value of an entity (data or application) to an organisation. For research data, however, the value to the University is in all cases the same. The value of each research project is the same. Does that mean that there is no need to classify research data? Referring back to the definition of security, it is the assessment of the level of protection against a certain threat and its accuracy depends on the value of (in this case) data. The reason to classify research data is that there is a huge variety in potential risks in case of data loss or theft.\nThe reason that VU and its reseachers need to classify data is to understand the variety in risk that exists in order to assess if security measures are accurate.\nData classification is about the level of sensitivity (low, medium or high) of your data assets so you can judge the risks to your research (group). This will help you when deciding what security and protection measures you need to take for handling the data or parts of the data.\n\nPolicy Classification of Research Data\nThe Policy Classification of Research Data addresses classification of research data in terms of availability, integrity and confidentiality, and how the classification process should be carried out. It is connected to the Research Data and Software Management Policy, because the latter states that data must be handled in a secure and reliable manner. The Research Data Classification Policy will determine what level of security measures are necessary to manage data securely.\n\n\nData classification criteria\nIn order to classify your data collection or data processing (in categories from low, to medium, or high), the following properties are considered.\n\nAvailability: what risks are associated with accessibility to data (i.e. how readily do the data need to be available for use and how damaging would it be to your research if data are lost), what measures should you take to prevent data loss?\nIntegrity: what do you do to prevent measurement or data entry errors, corruption of stored data or unauthorised changes to the stored data?\nConfidentiality: how securely do data need to be managed to prevent sharing of data with unauthorised individuals? The necessity for confidentiality depends on the sensitivity of the information, either as sensitive personal information or confidential business information, as well as the vulnerability of the subjects from whom the data is collected and the laws that apply to the data being collected and analysed. In some cases, confidentiality can be very high; when the confidentiality is high or very high, please contact the RDM Support Desk.\n\nFor all of these aspects, the damage impact should be considered, i.e. te risks to all parties involved (i.e. participants, but also VU Amsterdam as an institute, the researchers, any collaborators etc.). Untoward outcomes could be loss of privacy/secrecy, reputation damage, financial costs, fraud, mental, social or physical harm.\n\n\nExamples of Highly classified data\nYour data are classified as ‘high’ when you collect or process the following data:\n\npersonal data\nstate secrets\ncompetitive corporate information\nanimal-testing data\n\n\n\nPersonal data\nDo not confuse the risks of data loss with the need to comply to legal regulations. Data security is part of risk management and is aimed at balancing protection against productivity, investments against profit. The General Data Protection Regulation is a European Law in the legal area of Human Rights and concerns the use of personal data. Personal data are a type of data that is commonly processed in many fields of scientific research. You collect or process personal data when the data can be linked to a unique individual, either directly through direct identifiers such as name, address, IP-address etc., or indirectly through a combination of information. Personal data need to be protected. More information about personal data, data protection and the GDPR can be found in the section GDPR & Privacy.\n\n\nData Classification tool for researchers\nTo help you to determine the data classification for your research data assets, VU Amsterdam has developed a tool that will help you to assess and classify the availability, integrity and confidentiality risks of these assets. Based on your results from using the tool, you may need to seek further advice from VU Security and Privacy Experts (see below). Some basic security tips were compiled by the data steward of the Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences.\n\n\nVU Security and Privacy experts\nVU Security and Privacy experts can help you with the details on these aspects.\n\nGeneral questions about information security: RDM Support Desk. If you need advice when determining the data classification of your data assets, you can contact them.\nReporting a (potential) data breach: IT Servicedesk. A data breach is an incident in which the possibility exists that the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or data processing systems has been potentially threatened, for example attempts to gain unauthorised access to information or systems (hacking), the loss of a USB stick with sensitive information, data theft of hardware.\nTailored advice or support: The RDM Support Desk can assist researchers in the process of requesting capacity at IT for setting up and/or assessing of information security plans or paragraphs. An information security plan is particularly important in projects with a complex infrastructure (e.g. international collaboration, use of various data sources and databases), tailored solutions and requirements from funding agencies or external partners.\n\nRead more practical information about this below in the section Data Protection & Security, or the GDPR support section.\n\n\n\nData Protection & Security\nWhere sensitive information is collected, the researcher must consider the following:\n\nwho has access to the data during the study, and how the data will be made available after publication\nwhat security regimes apply to sensitive data, and how data are protected\nhow data access during and after the project will be managed\nhow to deal with sensitive information\nwhether informed consent is required and how the forms will be accessed and stored\n\nOn the 🔒 VU Intranet information is available on Security, data loss and reporting incidents. Legal experts also can help you if you have questions about working with personal data and/or if you have to perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment. On VU Amsterdam website you can find more information about 🔒 DPIAs at VU Amsterdam. The data steward for the Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences has also created a guide about data encryption."

The mission of RIOS is to strengthen the position of VU Amsterdam and Amsterdam UMC regarding research integrity and open science.\n\n\n\nNWO Data Policy\nNWO aims to ensure that all the research it funds is openly accessible to everyone as part of it’s Open Science policy. Researchers are therefore expected to preserve the data resulting from their projects for at least ten years, unless legal provisions or discipline-specific guidelines dictate otherwise. As much as possible, research data should be made publicly available for re-use. As a minimum, NWO requires that the data underpinning research papers should be made available to other researchers at the time of the article’s publication, unless there are valid reasons not to do so.\nThe guiding principle here is ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary.’ Due consideration is given to aspects such as privacy, public security, ethical limitations, property rights and commercial interests. In relation to research data, NWO recognizes that software (algorithms, scripts and code developed by researchers in the course of their work) may be necessary to access and interpret data. In such cases, the data management plan will be expected to address how information about such items will be made available alongside the data.\nMore information on Data Management is also available on the NWO website where a NWO Data Management Template is made available. The VU Data Management template in DMP Online is certified by both NWO and ZonMW and can also be used by VU researchers for projects funded by both organisations."

    "text": "Publishing online\nResearch code (or other code) is best stored on a git repostory, like GitHub or GitLab. Both platforms are is used by millions of programmers and researchers around the world. To upload your code to GitHub/GitLab, you first need to make an account here. Once you have an account, you can create a repository that hosts your code.\nGitHub: You can create a free account. In addition, as a university employee, you can use your university email address to get a free “Pro” account, which gives you access to some additional features. You can find more information at the GitHub Education platform. GitLab: As VU employee, you can access GitLab using your VU credentials (VUnetID) by logging in through the VU portal.\n\nCreating a repository\nGitHub: After logging in, click your profile picture on the top right -&gt; “Your repositories” -&gt; “New”. Choose a name and set the visibility (do you want everyone to see your code already or wait a bit before sharing with the world?). It is common practice to immediately add a “README” file and add a licence (see next section). You can update the visibility of your repository later under the repository settings.\nGitLab: After logging, click on “Projects” in the left menu, and then on “Create project”. Choose a name and set the visibility (do you want everyone to see your code already or wait a bit before sharing with the world?). It is common practice to immediately add a “README” file and add a licence (see next section). You can update the visibility of your repository later under the repository settings.\n\n\nAdding code to your repository\nGitHub: You can create a new file using the “Add file” or “+”-button.\nGitLab: You can create a new file using the “+”-button and click “New file”.\nOnce you have uploaded your files or written your code, you need to write a “commit” message. This is basically a description of the changes you made between the previous version of the code and the current version. Since this is the first version of the files (that is available online) you can write something like “initial”.\nNote: never put sentitive information (like passwords or API keys) in your code.\n\n\nUsing Git locally\nWhen you plan to use GitHub/GitLab more often, adding files through the web interface can become cumbersome. In that case, it is useful to consider using GitHub Desktop or a git manager which is integrated in your IDE (integrated development environment), like Visual Studio Code. Git can also be used on the command line, for example, when using git from a server. The course Learn Git & GitHub provides a useful tutorial on using git from the command line.\nWell done! Your research code is not sitting on your own computer (or worse – deleted after publication*), but is available online for others to find. This is step one in following the FAIR principles. In the remainder of this guide, you will find steps that will guide you through all steps to release a “perfect” code repository. The first sections are most important, further sections provide room for further improvement, so please use this guide at your own discretion.\n*VU Amsterdam requires research data and software to be preserved for at least 10 years, unless legal provisions or discipline-specific guidelines dictate otherwise, as per the Research Data and Software Management Policy. Note that funding organisations may have specific requirements for preserving code as well. If you receive external funding for your research, please make sure to familiarise yourself with such requirements."

    "section": "Licence",
    "text": "Licence\n\nLicensing software\nPublishing research software under an appropriate licence is crucial for its accessibility, usability, and further integration into research. Choosing a licence usually happens right when you start developing the software or when you put it in a public repository, rather than when the software is finished and fully baked.\nA software licence states how other people may re-use your code and under which circumstances. For research software, it is recommended (and often required by funders) that licences are as permissible as possible.\nThere are many licences out there; below we list some very frequently used licences in research software. However, if none of these licences fit your case, there are several tools that can help you to choose a suitable software licence. If you need guidance in choosing a licence for your software, get in touch with the RDM Support Desk.\n\n\nMIT License\nThe MIT License is a popular choice, due to its readability and permissiveness. It allows users to reuse the software for any purpose, including using, copying, modifying, and distributing it, provided they include the original copyright notice and licence text.\nHowever, its permissiveness means that derivative works can be closed-source and do not need to mention that they use your code, which might not align with all scientific openness goals or general.\n\n\nGNU GPLv3\nThe GNU General Public License (GPLv3) is another option, designed to ensure that the software and any derivatives remain open-source.\nThis encourages collaborative improvement of software. Any software that includes GPL-licensed code must also be open-source under the GPLpotentially deterring commercial use or integration with proprietary software. In conclusion, when you want your code to be used by others, but only the code that uses your code is also open source, this is the way to go.\n\n\nApache License 2.0\nThe Apache License 2.0 allows for modification and distribution of the software and its derivative works, with the requirement that changes to the original code are documented.\nIt is a more complex licence than the MIT License and can be incompatible with GPL-licensed software. The specifics of this go beyond the scope of the handbook.\n\n\nAdding a licence to GitHub\nOn GitHub you add a licence on creating a new repository, by selecting the licence from the drop-down menu. If your repository already exists, add a new file called “LICENSE” using the “+”-button on top of the repository (see below).\n\n\n\nLocation of file creation button\n\n\nOne the next page, start to type LICENSE as the file name, and a button to “Choose a license template” should automatically pop up. Follow the steps provided by GitHub to finish adding the licence to the repository.\nYou should now see your licence shown on the main page of your repository.\n\n\nFurther considerations\n\nIf you are reusing software or libraries written by someone else, you must stick to the clauses of the licence given to the original software/library;\nWhen choosing a licence, do not just think about what others may do with the software, but also what you might want to do with the software in the future."

    "section": "Persistent Identifier",
    "text": "Persistent Identifier\nA persistent identifier is a durable reference to a digital dataset, document, website or other object. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a widely used Persistent Identifier in the research domain and hence for research software as well. There are two ways to generate a DOI for your code. Depending on how often you intend to update your code, one or the other may be simpler.\n\nIf you do not intend to update your code often, it is sufficient to upload your code separately to Zenodo (or similar repository). This will then automatically generate a DOI for you, which can be included in a publication.\nIf however, you intend to update your code frequently, it may be easier to set up an automatic link between GitHub and Zenodo, so that a new version of the code is released on Zenodo on publication of a new version on GitHub. You can find instructions for this in this guide on referencing and citing content."

    "section": "Readme, commenting, code formatting",
    "text": "Readme, commenting, code formatting\nTo allow others to understand and use your code effectively it is important to include a “README” file, and to comment your code.\n\nReadme file\nThe README file is the general introduction to a code repository. A good readme includes the following components (but may include other sections depending on the project):\n\nProject Title\nProject description\nInstallation Instructions: Provide step-by-step guidelines to get the project running.\nUsage Examples: Include examples of how to use the code, which can be particularly beneficial for libraries or APIs.\nDependencies: List any libraries or other software required to run the project.\nLicense: Specify the licensing under which the code is released (see above).\nCitation: Collect more citations 😉 by providing researchers a way to easily cite your paper.\n[if applicable] Contributing Guidelines: Explain how others can contribute to the project.\n\nOn GitHub, the README file should ideally be named “README.md”. GitHub automatically renders this file and displays it on the home page of your repository. You can find an example of a README file in the numpy repository.\n\n\nCode commenting\nCode commenting serves several essential purposes, such as enhancing readability, maintainability, and usability for original authors, future contributors and others interested in your code. Comments provide context or explanations for complex logic, variables, and algorithms, making the codebase accessible and understandable. Good practices include describing the purpose of functions, explaining the rationale behind decisions, and highlighting potential side effects.\nA huge part of commenting your code is variable naming. Good variable naming can go a long way in making your code “self-documenting”. In general, do not use abbreviations or very short variable names. This may save a couple of keystrokes when writing your code, but this time is easily recovered when looking at the code again months later. Good variable naming will help your colleagues or other interested people even more. Modern integrated development environments also usually include autocompletion.\n\n\nCode formatting\nConsistency in code formatting, and adherence to standards can be highly beneficial, allowing other people and yourself to more quickly grasp your code. Each language has different conventions. For example, Python uses PEP8, for which some examples are given below:\n\nUse 4 spaces as indentation\nlocal variable_names are all lowercase\nClassNames have each word starting with a Capital letter\nGLOBAL_VARIABLES are all uppercase\n\nOther examples are Google’s R Style Guide and Google’s C++ Style Guide.\n\n\nCode formatting tools\nYou can also configure Visual Studio Code to automatically help you formatting your code. You can find more information in the Visual Studio code formatting manual. Even more strict formatting can be done with ruff, which is PEP8-compliant but introduces additional rules. ruff can also format your code in place, running ruff format {source_file_or_directory}.\nYou can also use GitHub Actions to automatically check and format your code when you push new commits to your repository. For example for Python, ruff publishes GitHub actions that can be used to automatically check and format your code.\nIf you follow the steps above, your code is now following the FAIR principles already! However, there is always room for improvement. Further steps are explained below."

    "text": "Documentation\nExtensive documentation can help users of your code re-use your code effectively. There are some great tools out there to help you automatically build documentation from your code comments, which can be supplemented with general documentation. Sphinx is a great way to do this, and can be nicely integrated with your existing GitHub repository. An example of code documentation can be found in the ReadTheDocs documentation, which uses Sphinx. This guide is not meant to be a full guide on how to use Sphinx as many useful resources can be found on the internet. An example of a great resource is this blog post.\n\nInstalling Sphinx\nTo use Sphinx for automatic documentation generation in a GitHub repository, start by installing Sphinx using pip (pip install sphinx). Next, run sphinx-quickstart in your project’s root directory to generate the basic configuration (conf.py) and structure for your documentation.\n\n\nAutomatic documentation building\nDocumentation can be automatically updated when you push new commits to your GitHub repository. To do so, you can set up a continuous integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions. In a workflow file, you specify the steps to install Sphinx, build the documentation using the sphinx-build command, and then push the generated HTML files to the gh-pages branch or another branch designated for hosting your documentation. A guide on how to set this up can be found in this Sphinx manual.\nThis guide is not meant to be a full guide on how to use Sphinx, as many useful resources can be found on the internet. However, some useful resources (here, and here) are listed, and pointers are given.\n\n\nAutomatically documenting your code\nTo document a Python function using autodoc, ensure that the functions in your code have a properly formatted docstring. For example:\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two numbers together.\n\n    :param a: first number\n    :type a: int or float\n    :param b: second number\n    :type b: int or float\n    :return: The sum of `a` and `b`\n    :rtype: int or float\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\nIn the conf.py file, enable the autodoc extension by adding 'sphinx.ext.autodoc' to the extensions list. This extension allows Sphinx to generate documentation directly from your source code’s docstrings. Then, in your Sphinx documentation source directory (usually docs/source), create a .rst file where you want this function’s documentation to appear. Use the autofunction directive to automatically include the function’s documentation:\n.. autofunction:: path.to.module.add_numbers\nReplace path.to.module with the actual Python import path to your function. Sphinx will extract the docstring from the function and incorporate it into the generated documentation, complete with the parameter descriptions and types."

There are two “levels” of publishing your code. First of all, you can ensure that your code is directly installable from the GitHub repository. To do so, you can follow the steps explained in this Python tutorial, but only up to and including the section “Configuring metadata”. Here, we assume you already created a README.md and added a LICENCE as explained above.\nIn brief, you need to take the following steps, which are explained in full below:\n\nStructure your code as a package\nCreate a metadata file\n\nThen, once this is added to GitHub, you can install the package using the following command (of course adjusted to point to your own repository):\npip install git+https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git\n\nPyPi\nIf this works, you can go on to the next step and publish your package on PyPi. When your package is published here, it is possible to directly install your code from pip, as such:\npip install your_package\nFor a full explanation of how to do so, follow the remaining steps explained in this Python tutorial.\n\n\nAutomatic publishing versions\nIf you publish new versions frequently, it may be useful to automatically release these versions to PyPi, directly from GitHub without taking manual steps.

For this hackathon, we focused on adding new content and consolidating requests.\nWe had a large number of contributions related to tools. The handbook now has information about Research Cloud, SciCloud and Yoda. These were long-standing issues and it is really nice that they turned into topics.\nIrene helped us to revise the metadata topic.\nTycho is working on a page for ORCID, the ORCID Libguide page will be adjusted to redirect to the handbook.\nLena was working on a data backup topic, trying to make it generic and applicable to multiple tools.\nWe had a discussion of an overview page. New colleagues also within support miss an overview of the services available. There are many pages that give some ideas: the RDS portal on Tools, the guide on available services and RISP - but all these overviews have diverse struggles so we are still looking for a good way of doing it.\nITvO colleagues noticed that they miss an official VU page which gives a summary of what ITvO is and does.\nQuestion that came up: how to add new contributors? Do they need access rights? Do they work with forks or branches?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Last week we added a new section to the Research Support Handbook: Manuals. Manuals are short pages describing how to accomplish specific tasks in a Tool and should be easily understood by individuals with varying levels of technical knowledge. Manuals on the handbook will be written in the form of a how-to. The aim is to provide guidance for specific tasks “How do I?”. From the basic: “How do I log in” to the more in-depth “How do I use CUDA on ADA”.\nWe have started by migrating the manuals on using Yoda, from their old spot on yoda.vu.nl. Next step will be migrating the ADA HPC manuals from readthedocs.\nBy consolidating all user manuals on the Research Support Handbook we hope to increase the findability of both the manuals and the rest of the Research Support Handbook."

This ensures that the right page shows up displaying the right content.\nFor example, if you are interested in the DataverseNL page, you can select any of the headings as an anchor. Here are the steps involved:\n\nIdentify the specific anchor to embed at (for example, “How to request access”)\nClick the link icon next to the anchor\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the anchor and the link icon highlighted\n\n\n\nGo to your browser’s navigation bar and copy the new link (https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/dataversenl.html#how-to-request-access)\n\nThis link is all you need to anchor the embedding itself, which we explain in the section How to embed."

You can copy-paste this into any handbook page directly or into any HTML editor:\n\n\nYou can find the detailed code on how this page embeds the content, on GitHub, from line 43.\nThanks for reading and good luck creating your own embeds of the Research Support Handbook across VU Amsterdam pages 😊 If you have questions or it does not work and you don’t understand why, please contact the RDM Support Desk and one of the editors will try to help you."

    "text": "On October 30th, 2024, all authors participated in the fourth hackathon for the Research Support Handbook. Since the third hackathon, we migrated to rdm.vu.nl, which is a huge milestone! 🎉\nFor the fourth hackathon, we focused on tying up loose ends that we accumulated. The migration means we are now in a stable state, yet there is always more work to be done. During this hackathon, we focused on picking up stale discussions, reviewing open pull requests, and generally closing issues that we took too long to revisit.\nWe considered how (un)balanced the various Topics had gotten, because we want readers to be able to form consistent expectations. We observed that some topics are related to tools, others to concepts. Some topics are concise, whereas others are lengthy.\nOne breakout group focused on creating templates for both kinds of topics, resulting in an initial structure that will make it easier to start new topics in the future. Specifically we propose the following template structure for tools (for example, Qualtrics, HPC, DMPonline):\nAnd the following structure for concepts (for example, DMP, data citation, data storage):\nWe will follow up with a new hackathon in late november."
