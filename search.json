This is not a problem so go ahead!\nThe chapter itself needs to be written in Markdown. Every chapter must contain a first level heading (e.g., # Heading), which will be the chapter title. Section headings are second level headings (e.g., ## Section).\nAfter that, you are ready to submit your pull request! The reviewers will help you place the chapter in the right place of the book.1"

The people maintaining the handbook will review what you wrote, ask some questions, and accept or decline your contributions.\nWe recommend keeping your suggested changes small or limited in scope, and explaining why you are suggesting these changes. It is more likely your changes are included when you are fixing a typo or adding a paragraph, and less likely if you are revising the entire handbook. It is also more likely they are included if you explain why you are suggesting the changes, rather than dropping by and making edits without any context.\nIf you are adding a new chapter, it is definitely recommended to open an issue first to see whether there is a need for it (and maybe you’ll find collaborators!).\nDuring the review process you may be asked to update your changes, or revisions may be added by the people maintaining the handbook. It is helpful if you keep an eye on your GitHub account to ensure timely responses to help the process along."

This act of creating a copy is called “forking.”\nWhen you create a copy, you do not have to worry about accidentally removing or destroying the handbook.
