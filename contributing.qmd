### Suggesting edits

The easiest and quickest way to contribute to the book is make suggested edits. On each page you will find a button reading "Edit this page" (usually on the right).

![Screenshot of a handbook topic, with a red box on the right hand side of the page indicating where to find the "Edit this page" button](public/Screenshot%202023-12-19%20at%2010.41.49.png)

When you click that, you will immediately be taken to GitHub to edit the text of that specific page. You may be prompted to [create a fork (forking)](#forking) in case these are your first edits.

Once you made your edits, you are ready to commit (save) your changes and [submit your pull request](#submit-a-pull-request), requesting those changes to be included in the handbook.

### Adding a topic

To add a new topic, you need to create a new file ending in `.qmd` (e.g., `topics/example.qmd`). You can do this by visiting the [handbook page on GitHub]({{< var repo-url >}}) and clicking `Add file -> New file`.

![Screenshot of GitHub highlighting where to find the "New file" button](public/Screenshot%202023-12-19%20at%2010.54.20.png)

When you click this button you may be asked to [fork](#forking) the repository. This is not a problem so go ahead!

The topic itself needs to be [written in Markdown](#writing-text). Every topic must contain a first level heading (e.g., `# Heading`), which will be the topic title. Section headings are second level headings (e.g., `## Section`).

After that, you are ready to [submit your pull request](#submit-a-pull-request)! The reviewers will help you place the topic in the right place of the book.[^1]

[^1]: If you are really enthusiastic and want to do it yourself: The topic needs to be added to the topics list in `_quarto.yml`. You can find the topics list around line 24 of that file.

### Submit a pull request

Once you have made suggested changes, a pull request is the way for you to ask for your changes to be incorporated into the handbook. The people maintaining the handbook will review what you wrote, ask some questions, and accept or decline your contributions.

We recommend keeping your suggested changes small or limited in scope, and explaining why you are suggesting these changes. It is more likely your changes are included when you are fixing a typo or adding a paragraph, and less likely if you are revising the entire handbook. It is also more likely they are included if you explain why you are suggesting the changes, rather than dropping by and making edits without any context.

If you are adding a new topic, it is definitely recommended to [open an issue first]({{< var issue-url >}}) to see whether there is a need for it (and maybe you'll find collaborators!).

During the review process you may be asked to update your changes, or revisions may be added by the people maintaining the handbook. It is helpful if you keep an eye on your GitHub account to ensure timely responses to help the process along.

### Writing text

The book is created using Markdown - you can get familiarized with [the basic syntax on the Markdown website](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax). The getting started quick items are:

```md
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3

You simply write text as you are used to. To make something *italic*, **bold**, or ***bold and italic***.

> this is how you add quotes

- or lists
- that can go on 
- and on
```

If you want to add code, use references, create links, or footnotes - it is all possible. We will expand examples here based on your needs, so if you need help, [let us know by reporting an issue]({{< var issue-url >}})!

### More information about GitHub

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) to create this website automatically, and to manage all the incoming updates. You do not need to know how it works entirely, but we want to help you understand some things so you are not confused.

#### Repository

A repository on GitHub is like a folder on your computer. This can be many things, depending on what files it contains.

When we mention a repository here, we mean that we want you to look at a specific folder. The [repository for this website for example can be found on GitHub directly]({{< var repo-url >}}). You will always be contributing to a repository, in order to contribute to the handbook.

#### Forking

A repository is owned by one or multiple people on GitHub. If you are not one of them, you can create a copy of the repository (folder) to make your edits in. This act of creating a copy is called "forking."

When you create a copy, you do not have to worry about accidentally removing or destroying the handbook. Your changes are not reflected in the website until you [submit a pull request](#submit-a-pull-request).
