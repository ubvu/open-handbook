# About

The Open Handbook is a project started by Research Data Support in early 2024. After planning and design phases, we launched the initial version of the resource at the Research Support Days in May 2024.

The Open Handbook centralizes resources that VU researchers need to do their work. The Open Handbook also provides everyone with direct pathways to change resources in case anything has become outdated.

Previously such resources were spread out across many different pages at VU and were hard to update. The Open Handbook is curated by us all, and reviewed by specialists. This way we can help each other.

## Contributors

The Open Handbook was initiated by Lena Karvovskaya, Jessica Hrudey, Elisa, and Jolien Scholten. The initial infrastructure for the Open Handbook was built by Liberate Science.

We want to specifically call out the following folk who contributed outside of GitHub:

* Jochem Lybaart
