## Offboarding

When leaving VU Amsterdam, you are likely to leave behind project-related data. This data needs to be [archived](../topics/data-archiving) and be accessible for other researchers for verification of research data. This is also an important step in complying with regulations of funding organisations. Furthermore, researchers who remain at VU Amsterdam may want to use your data in the future. To facilitate this, we provide a template to fill out that can be handed over to your manager.

Furthermore, for removing data, it is important that you make clear which data can be removed. If this is not done, it remains unclear to your department/manager whether the data can be removed in accordance with agreements with research funders (e.g., Dutch Research Council, NWO) and privacy laws (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR).

Note: this is a general template and the process may vary from department to department. Therefore, we recommend that you check with your department if any department-specific workflows are in place.

### Data Removal

I declare that all important data was archived (see above), and my account and associated data can be removed on the following platforms:

* [ ] SciStor
* [ ] SurfDrive
* [ ] Research Drive
* [ ] Yoda Active storage
* [ ] OneDrive
* [ ] Lab journals
* [ ] Other, namely ….

Archiving data is a relatively long-term solution, but even archived data has a lifespan (e.g., Yoda data will be removed after 10 years by default). What should happen when data is due for removal from the archiving platform?

* [ ] Data can be removed.
* [ ] A decision on further archiving can be made by:
      - Name:
      - Position:
      - Department and faculty:
      - Email (or other contact info):
