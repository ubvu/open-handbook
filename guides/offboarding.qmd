## Offboarding

When leaving the VU, you are likely to leave behind project-related data. This data needs to be [archived](../topics/data-archiving) and be accessible by other researchers for verification of research data. This is also an important step in complying with regulations of funding organisations. Furthermore, researchers who remain at the VU may want to use your data in the future. To facilite this, we provide a template to fill out that can be handed over to your manager.

Furthermore, for removing data, it is important that you make clear which data can be removed. If this is not done, it remains unclear to your department/manager whether the data can be removed in accordance with agreements with research funders (e.g., Dutch Research Council, NWO) and privacy laws (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR).

Note: this is a general template and the process may vary from department to department. Therefore, we recommend that you check with your department if any department-specific workflows are in place.
