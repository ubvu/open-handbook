Welcome to the VU! This guide collects the most important information for starting researchers at the VU.

## Data storage and backup

The VU provides various platforms for [data storage](../topics/data-storage.qmd). In addition, please make sure you backup your data.

## Data management plan

[A Data Management Plan](../topics/data-management-plan.qmd) (DMP) is a structured plan for data collection, organization, storage, sharing, and preservation. For many projects with external funding, for example by NWO, it is required to write a DMP. Even if it is not required, it is highly advised to write one, to consiously think about how you handle your data.

## Data regulations

When processing and storing data, you must consider relevant regulations. For some data (e.g., open-source data), very little has to be done, but for other (e.g., medical data) strict regulations are in place. On these pages, you can find information about data [regulations](./policies-supporting-vision-open-science.qmd), [ethical review](../topics/ethical-review.qmd) and [informed consent](./comply-with-gdpr.qmd).

## Software

When working with and publishing software, it is advisable to follow several [best practices](./publishing-fair-software.qmd), including folloing the FAIR guiding principles, meaning Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets. You can find a guide with some starting points.

## Completion of research (data archiving)

When finishing up your research, your data can be [archived](../topics/data-archiving.qmd) alongside publications. Even, if this is not the case, you may still need to archive the data and software.

## Technical support

The VU provides [support](../guides/data-lifecycle.qmd) to help you in the entire process of managing data during your research.

## Final notes

While these provide some general starting points, all research is unique, we advise to browse around on this website to see if there are more important topics to be found. See the list of [topics](../topics.qmd) and [guides](../guides.qmd).
