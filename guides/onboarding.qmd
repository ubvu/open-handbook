## Introduction


The following guide will walk you through you research data management needs from before the research project has begun to once your research project is over or you have left the VU. You can explore the information using the powerpoint here: or by reading through each of the sections on this page. Overall this information is meant to be a jumping off point so please be sure to check your faculty specific policies and guidelines.\

## Explore funding & data

### Pre-existing datasets

See [Find Existing Data](https://rdm.vu.nl/topics/finding-existing-data.html)\


## Investigate your legal responsibilities

### Knowledge Security

**What is it**

The undesirable transfer of sensitive information impacting Netherlands’ national security.

Covert influencing of education andresearch by dangerous state actors

Collaboration with individuals and institutions from countries that do not respect fundamental rights

**How does it impact you\***

Primary responsible researcher answers 6 framework questions​

One yes = risk assessment needed (contact [faculty knowledge security officer](https://vu.nl/en/employee/onderwijs-en-onderzoeksbeleid/knowledge-security-for-vu-amsterdam-employees#:~:text=Faculty%20contact%20persons)for assistance)

If needed, they contact the [VU knowledge security advisory group](mailto:kennisveiligheid@vu.nl)for advice\

*\*If you’re conducting international collaborations (formal, informal, hiring, visitors)*

*See [Knowledge Security](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/more-about/knowledge-security) for more information*\

### VU Knowledge Security Framework

**Legal framework – what is not permitted, or under conditions**

1\. Does the collaboration concern a sanctioned person, entity or body? Or is the combination of the technology and country sanctioned? - See [EU sanctions list](https://www.sanctionsmap.eu/#/main).

2\. Is the Dual Use regime applicable to the research? - Contact the [KS advisory team](mailto:kennisveiligheid@vu.nl)for advice.

**Risk management – what else should be considered**

3.  Is, or has the partner been affiliated to a military organization outside the EU?- collaboration with military organisations outside EU is undesirable.

4\. Does the collaboration involve sensitive research?

5\. Do ethical dilemmas play a role? - check if the partner is based in county which scores 0.4 or less on the [Academic Freedom Index](https://academic-freedom-index.net/).

6\. Does unilateral external funding occur in the cooperation? - Check [AFI](https://academic-freedom-index.net/)

**No limitations – cooperation can take place**

7\. There are no obstacles for the collaboration from a knowledge security perspective\

### WMO/METc

**Research falls under the WMO if the following two conditions are met:**

-   it concerns medical-scientific research; and

-   people are subjected to procedures or are required to follow rules of behaviour\

**Some research may require a non-WMO declaration:**

-   You need a non-WMO statement/approval from a recognised METC, for example for publication.

-   Non-WMO statement is not ethical approval, check with your faculty ethics committee if you need to undergo a full ethical review\

*Resource: [WMO research – METC](https://metc.amsterdamumc.org/wmo/wmo-onderzoek/)*\

## Conduct your research


### Data Collection
